ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
The perception about disaster and its management has undergone a change following
the enactment of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The definition of disaster is now all
encompassing, which includes not only the events emanating from natural and man-made
causes, but even those events which are caused by accident or negligence. There was a long
felt need to capture information about all such events occurring across the sectors and efforts
made to mitigate them in the country and to collate them at one place in a global perspective.
This book has been an effort towards realising this thought. This book in the present format is
the outcome of the in-house compilation and analysis of information relating to disasters and
their management gathered from different sources (domestic as well as the UN and other such
agencies).
All the three Directors in the Disaster Management Division, namely Shri J.P. Misra, Shri Dev
Kumar and Shri Sanjay Agarwal have contributed inputs to this Book relating to their sectors.
Support extended by Prof. Santosh Kumar, Shri R.K. Mall, former faculty and Shri Arun Sahdeo
from NIDM have been very valuable in preparing an overview of the book. This book would have
been impossible without the active support, suggestions and inputs of Dr. J. Radhakrishnan,
Assistant Country Director (DM Unit), UNDP, New Delhi and the members of the UNDP Disaster
Management Team including Shri Arvind Sinha, Consultant, UNDP. Support was extended by all
the concerned ministries who provided the data that has been used in compiling this book. We
sincerely acknowledge the organisations and the individuals whose photographs, figures and
tables have been used in the presentation of this book for highlighting the issues concerned.
While compiling disaster issues across the sectors, for the first time, with substantial information
pertaining to other nodal ministries dealing with the subject, the chances of errors creeping
in, is not ruled out. There would always be scope of improvement in the accuracy of material
and analysis of facts. It is, however, expected that in the days to come, on the base prepared,
this will be further improved upon, following the suggestions received from the end users. In
producing this document, the cooperation extended by colleagues from different ministries/
departments and Government agencies is acknowledged. Without the consistent guidance
and support extended by Shri G.K. Pillai, Union Home Secretary and Shri A.E. Ahmad, Secretary
(Border Management) it would not have been possible to prepare this document.

Disasters in India An Overview

1.1 Introduction
1.1.1 India’s geo-climatic conditions as well as its high degree of socio-economic vulnerability,
makes it one of the most disaster prone country in the world. A disaster is an extreme disruption
of the functioning of a society that causes widespread human, material, or environmental losses
that exceed the ability of the affected society to cope with its own resources. Disasters are
sometimes classified according to whether they are “natural” disasters, or “human-made” disasters.
For example, disasters caused by floods, droughts, tidal waves and earth tremors are generally
considered “natural disasters.” Disasters caused by chemical or industrial accidents, environmental
pollution, transport accidents and political unrest are classified as “human-made” or “humaninduced” disasters since they are the direct result of human action.
1.1.2 A more modern and social understanding of disasters, however, views this distinction as
artificial since most disasters result from the action or inaction of people and their social and
economic structures. This happens by people living in ways that degrade their environment,
developing and over populating urban centres, or creating and perpetuating social and
economic systems. Communities and population settled in areas susceptible to the impact of
a raging river or the violent tremors of the earth are placed in situations of high vulnerability
because of their socio-economic conditions. This is compounded by every aspect of nature
being subject to seasonal, annual and sudden fluctuations and also due to the unpredictability
of the timing, frequency and magnitude of occurrence of the disasters.

1.2 Etymology
The word ‘Disaster’ derives from Middle French désastre1 and that from Old Italian disastro, which
in turn comes from the Greek pejorative prefix δυσ-, (dus-) “bad”+ αστήρ (aster), “star”. The root of
the word disaster2 (“bad star” in Greek and Latin) comes from an astrological theme in which the
ancients used to refer to the destruction or deconstruction of a star as a disaster.

1.3 Definition
1.3.1 Disaster is an event or series of events, which gives rise to casualties and damage or loss of
properties, infrastructures, environment, essential services or means of livelihood on such a scale
which is beyond the normal capacity of the affected community to cope with. Disaster is also
sometimes described as a “catastrophic situation in which the normal pattern of life or eco-system
has been disrupted and extra-ordinary emergency interventions are required to save and preserve
lives and or the environment”.
1.3.2 The Disaster Management Act, 2005 defines disaster as “a catastrophe, mishap, calamity or
grave occurrence in any area, arising from natural or man made causes, or by accident or negligence
which results in substantial loss of life or human suffering or damage to, and destruction of, property,
or damage to, or degradation of, environment, and is of such a nature or magnitude as to be beyond
the coping capacity of the community of the affected area”.
1.3.3 The United Nations defines disaster as “the occurrence of sudden or major misfortune which
disrupts the basic fabric and normal functioning of the society or community”.

1.4 Disasters not new to Mankind
1.4.1 Disasters are not new to mankind. They have been the constant, though inconvenient,
companions of the human beings since time immemorial. Disasters can be natural or humanmade. Earthquake, cyclone, hailstorm, cloud-burst, landslide, soil erosion, snow avalanche,

1

Disaster Management in India
flood etc. are the examples of natural disasters while fire, epidemics, road, air, rail accidents and
leakages of chemicals/ nuclear installations etc. fall under the category of human-made disasters.
The High Power Committee on Disaster Management, constituted in 1999, has identified 31
various disasters categorized into five major sub-groups which are given in Box 1.1.

1.5 Database
The mechanism for preparing a database for different kinds of disasters happening across the
country is yet to be developed. National Institute for Disaster Management (NIDM), under the
Disaster Management Act, 2005 has been tasked with research work and it is expected that it
would develop a mechanism to capture such data on the disasters including its impact on socioeconomic life of the nation and GDP growth. At the global level, the three main sources which
have been collecting the data are EM-DAT, Natcat and Sigma. EM-DAT is the acronym for data that
the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology on Disasters (CRED) has been collecting from the

2

An Overview
countries since 1987 (going back to 1900). Munich Reinsurance Company maintains Natcat and
Swiss Reinsurance Company maintains Sigma. The authenticity of the data collected by these
agencies varies and the figures given by them do not necessarily attest to any comprehensive
data and may be exaggerated sometimes which was realized in the case of the report given in
respect of 1999 landslides in Venezuela3.
1.5.1 Lack of Central Statistical database as a record of past disasters is a major constraint for risk
assessment and compilation of disaster history in the country. Different sources of data have
different figures of casualties and impacts, thereby hindering an objective assessment. Scientific
data on major hazards are available but information on vulnerabilities are scattered in multiple
places and often such data are not available uniformly for the entire country.
1.5.2 Disaster information available from different sources are yet to be regularly assessed by
common public as well as other stakeholders. Lack of awareness about available resources is a
reason for lack of last mile reach of the available information.
1.5.3 In India, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation have taken initiatives for
collection of data in respect of different disasters. A Technical Committee was constituted by the
Central Statistics Office with a view to prepare a framework for disaster statistics for developing
a database on disaster and related aspects. Five formats have been developed for capturing the
information about (i) Statistics on disaster at district level, (ii) Statistics on relief, rehabilitation and
reconstruction at district level, (iii) District wise compilation of statistics on disaster, (iv) Districtwise compilation of statistics on relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction and (v) Aggregation of
damage and relief data at state level. The state Government and District level institutions would
be required to furnish this information for preparing the data base at centralized level.

1.6. Disasters – Global Scenario4
1.6.1 Disasters - natural or human-made are common throughout the world. Disasters continue
to occur without warning and are perceived to be on an increase in their magnitude, complexity,
frequency and economic impact. Hazards pose threats to people and assume serious proportions
in the under developed countries with dense population. During the second half of the 20th
century, more than 200 worst natural disasters occurred in the different parts of the world
and claimed lives of around 1.4 million people. Losses due to natural disasters are 20 times
greater (as % of GDP) in the developing countries than in industrialized one. Asia tops the list
of casualties due to natural disasters. Figure 1.1 shows the Regional distribution of disasters by
type, as prepared by Centre for Research on Epidemiology of Disaster.
1.6.2 There have been several natural, as well as, man-made disasters. Records of natural disasters
can be traced way back to 430 B.C. when the Typhus epidemic was reported in Athens. Ten
deadliest natural disasters recorded in the world are dated back to 1556 when an earthquake in
Shaanxi province of China occurred on 23rd January, 1556 and 8,30,000 casualties were recorded.
List of ten deadliest disasters which have occurred across the world and in India in the known
history and in the last century may be seen from the Table 1.1 and Table 1.2 respectively.

1.6.5 Indian Scenario: India due to its geo-climatic and socio-economic condition is prone to
various disasters. During the last thirty years time span the country has been hit by 431 major
disasters resulting into enormous loss to life and property. According to the Prevention Web
statistics, 143039 people were killed and about 150 crore were affected by various disasters in
the country during these three decades. The disasters caused huge loss to property and other
infrastructures costing more than US $ 4800 crore. The most severe disasters in the country
and their impact in term of people affected, lives lost and economic damage is given in the

1.6.6 In India, the cyclone which occurred on 25th November, 1839 had a death toll of three lakh
people. The Bhuj earthquake of 2001 in Gujarat and the Super Cyclone of Orissa on 29th October,
1999 are still fresh in the memory of most Indians. The most recent natural disaster of a cloud
burst resulting in flash floods and mudflow in Leh and surrounding areas in the early hours of
6th August, 2010, caused severe damage in terms of human lives as well as property. There was
a reported death toll of 196 persons, 65 missing persons, 3,661 damaged houses and 27,350
hectares of affected crop area.
1.6.7 Floods, earthquakes, cyclones, hailstorms, etc. are the most frequently occurring disasters

1.6.8 The hazard vulnerability of the country as shown in Figure 1.7 finds a face when we look
at the major disasters of the country from 1980-2010. During this period of 30 years the country
has been hit by approximately 25 major disasters apart from the heat wave, cold wave and heavy
winds affecting some areas of the country.

An Overview

1.7. Vulnerability Profile of India
1.7.1 India has been vulnerable, in varying degrees, to a large number of natural, as well as,
human-made disasters on account of its unique geo-climatic and socio-economic conditions. It
is highly vulnerable to floods, droughts, cyclones, earthquakes, landslides, avalanches and forest
fires. Out of 35 states and union territories in the country, 27 of them are disaster prone. Almost
58.6 per cent of the landmass is prone to earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity; over 40
million hectares (12 per cent of land) are prone to floods and river erosion; of the 7,516 km long
coastline, close to 5,700 km is prone to cyclones and tsunamis; 68 per cent of the cultivable area
is vulnerable to drought and hilly areas are at risk from landslides and avalanches. A multi-hazard
map of India may be seen in Figure 1.8.
Hazard Profile of India
(a) India is one of the ten worst disaster prone countries of the world. The country is prone to
disasters due to number of factors; both natural and human induced, including adverse geo
climatic conditions, topographic features, environmental degradation, population growth,
urbanisation, industrialization, non scientific development practices etc. The factors either
in original or by accelerating the intensity and frequency of disasters are responsible for
heavy toll of human lives and disrupting the life supporting system in the country.
The basic reason for the high vulnerability of the country to natural disasters is its unique
geographical and geological situations. As far as the vulnerability to disaster is concerned,
the five distinctive regions of the country i.e. Himalayan region, the alluvial plains, the hilly
part of the peninsula, and the coastal zone have their own specific problems. While on one
hand the Himalayan region is prone to disasters like earthquakes and landslides, the plain is
affected by floods almost every year. The desert part of the country is affected by droughts
and famine while the coastal zone susceptible to cyclones and storms.
(b) The natural geological setting of the country is the primary basic reason for its increased
vulnerability. The geo-tectonic features of the Himalayan region and adjacent alluvial
plains make the region susceptible to earthquakes, landslides, water erosion etc. Though
peninsular India is considered to be the most stable portions, but occasional earthquakes in
the region shows that geo- tectonic movements are still going on within its depth.
(c) The tectonic features, characteristics of the Hiamalya are prevalent in the alluvial plains
of Indus, Ganga and Brahmputra too, as the rocks lying below the alluvial pains are just
extension of the Himalayan ranges only. Thus this region is also quite prone to seismic
activities. As a result of various major river systems flowing from Himalaya and huge quantity
of sediment brought by them, the area is also suffering from river channel siltation, resulting
into frequent floods, especially in the plains of Uttar Pardesh and Bihar.
(d) The western part of the country, including Rajasthan, Gujarat and some parts of Maharashtra
are hit very frequently by drought situation. If Monsoon worsens the situation spreads in
other parts of the country too. The disturbance in the pressure conditions over oceans,
results into cyclones in coastal regions. The geo tectonic movements going on in the ocean
floor make the coastal region prone to tsunami disaster too.
(e) The extreme weather conditions, huge quantity of ice and snow stored in the glaciers etc.
are other natural factors which make the country prone to various forms of disasters.
(f ) Along with the natural factors discussed in the preceding text, various human induced
activities like increasing demographic pressure, deteriorating environmental conditions,

An Overview
deforestation, unscientific development, faulty agricultural practices and grazing, unplanned
urbanisation, construction of large dams on river channels etc. are also responsible for
accelerated impact and increase in frequency of disasters in the country.

Losses due to disasters have been shown in Figure 1.9. It shows that economic loss is accounted for
2% of the GDP due to disasters as per the study of the World Bank.
1.7.2 Vulnerability to disasters or emergencies of Chemical, Biological Radiological and Nuclear
(CBRN) origin has increased on account of socio-economic development. Heightened vulnerabilities
to disaster risks can be related to expanding population, urbanization and industrialization,
development within high-risk zones, environmental degradation and climate change.
During the last two decades of the 19th century (1982-2001), natural disasters in India had
claimed a total death toll of around 1, 07,813 people (on an average more than 5,390 death
toll every year). As mentioned above, India with its extended coast line is exposed to five to six
tropical cyclones on an average, both from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal annually.
1.7.3 Climate Change: This is
evident from the increase in the
global average air and ocean
temperatures, precipitation and
extreme rainfall, widespread
melting of snow and ice, storms/
storm surges/coastal flooding and
rising global mean sea level, as
recorded in the fourth Assessment
Report of Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
Figure 1.10. Climate change
is expected to increase the

Disaster Management in India
frequency and intensity of current extreme weather events and give rise to new vulnerabilities
with differential spatial and socio-economic impacts on communities. The unprecedented
increase is expected to have severe impacts on the hydrological cycle, water resource, droughts,
flood, drinking water, forest and ecosystems, sea level/coastal area losses of coastal wetlands
and mangroves, food security, health and other related areas. The impact would be particularly
disastrous for developing countries, including India and further degrade the resilience of poor,
vulnerable communities, which make up between one quarter and one half of the population of
the most Indian cities.
1.7.4 Reason for concern: There is clear evidence that the observed change in surface
temperature, rainfall, evaporation and extreme events and climate change is a significant
environmental challenge. The main impact of global climate change will be felt due to changes
in climate variability and weather extremes. Observations during the last decade and projections
indicate that extreme events i.e. heat waves, cold waves, more floods, more droughts, more
intense cyclones and flash floods will increase. Extreme rainfall has substantially increased over
large areas, particularly over the west coast and west central India. There is thus an urgent need
for a paradigm shift in disaster management, especially under changing climate.
1.7.5 Poverty and disaster vulnerability: Poverty and risk to disasters are inextricably linked and
mutually reinforcing. The poor section of the society is worst affected in case of disaster. The situation
further aggravates due to the compulsion of the poor to exploit environmental resources for their
survival, increasing the risk and exposure of the society to disasters, in particular those triggered by
flood, drought and landslides. Poverty also compels the poor to migrate and live at physically more
vulnerable locations, often on unsafe land and in unsafe shelters. These inhabitations of the poor at
such locations are either due to the fact that there is no other land available at reasonable cost or
it is close to the employment opportunities. The inhabitations of the poor people on marginal land
are prone to all types of disasters. The type of construction of these houses further deteriorates the
condition. These dwellings made up of low cost material without giving much consideration to
technical aspect are easy targets of various hazards.

1.8. Climate Profile5
1.8.1 India is home to an extraordinary variety of climatic regions, ranging from tropical in the
south to temperate and alpine in the Himalayan north. The nation’s climate is strongly influenced
by the Himalayas and the Thar deserts. For the purpose of identification of drought prone
areas by Central Water Commission (CWC) the criteria adopted was that “drought is a situation
occurring in an area when the annual rainfall is less than 75 percent of normal in 20 percent of
the years examined. Any block or equivalent unit where 30 percent or more of the cultivated
area is irrigated is considered to have reached a stage, which enables it to sustain a reasonable
protection against drought”. A study rainfall data from 1875 to 1998 indicated the percentage
area of the country affected by moderate and severe drought. It may be noted that during the
complete 124 year period there were three occasions i.e. 1877, 1899 and 1918 when percentage
of the country affected by drought was more than 60 percent).
1.8.2 In the span of 124 years, the probability of occurrence of drought was found maximum in
Rajasthan (25 %), Saurastra & Kutch (23%), followed by Jammu & Kashmir (21%) and Gujarat (21%)
region. The drought of 1987 in various parts of the country was of “unprecedented intensity”
resulting in serious crop damages and an alarming scarcity of drinking water.

14

An Overview
1.8.3 Rainfall in India: The country is influenced by two seasons of rains, accompanied
by seasonal reversal of winds from January to July. Consequent to the intense heat of the
summer months, the northern Indian landmass becomes hot and draws moist winds over the
oceans causing a reversal of the winds over the region called the summer or the south-west
(SW) monsoon. This is most important feature controlling the Indian climate because about
75 percent of the annual rainfall is received during a short span of four months ie June to
September. There is a large variation in the amounts of rainfall received at different locations.
The average annual rainfall is less than 13 cm over the western Rajasthan, while Mausiram in
the Meghalaya has as much as 1141 cm. During the period from 1871 to 2009, there were 27
major drought years in India. One of the major reasons for these droughts has been a strong
link with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) patterns and its linkages with Indian food
grain production.
1.8.4 South West Monsoon: The rainfall over India has large spatial as well as temporal variability.
A homogeneous data series has been constructed for the period 1901-2003. Mean monthly
rainfall during July (286.5 mm) is the highest and contributes about 24.2 percent of the annual
rainfall (1182.8 mm). The mean rainfall during August is slightly lower and contributes 21.2
percent of the annual rainfall. June and September rainfalls are almost similar and contribute
13.8 percent and 14.2 percent of the annual rainfall, respectively. The mean south-west monsoon
(June, July, August and September) rainfall (877.2 mm) contributes 74.2 percent of the annual
rainfall (1182.8 mm).
1.8.5 The onset of the SW monsoon normally starts over the Kerala coast, the southern tip of
the country by 1st June, advances along the Konkan coast in early June and covers the whole
country by middle of July. Onset occurs about a week earlier over islands in the Bay of Bengal.
The monsoon is influenced by global and local phenomenon like EI Nino, northern hemisphere
temperature, sea surface temperatures, snow cover etc. The monsoon rainfall oscillates between
active spells associated with widespread rains over most parts of the country. Heavy rainfall in
the mountainous catchment under ‘break’ conditions result in flooding of the plains.
1.8.6 Cyclonic systems of low pressure called ‘monsoon depressions’ are formed in the Bay
of Bengal during this season. These systems generally form in the northern part of the Bay
with average frequency of about two to three per month and move in a northward or northwestward direction, bringing well distributed rainfall over the central and northern parts of
the country. The SW monsoon generally starts withdrawing from Rajasthan by 1st September
and from north-western part of India by 15th September. It withdraws from almost all parts of
the country by 15th October. It is replaced by a northerly continental airflow called North-East
Monsoon. The retreating monsoon winds cause occasional showers along the east coast of
Tamil Nadu.
1.8.7 North East Monsoon: Post- monsoon or Northeast monsoon or Retreating SW Monsoon
Season (October, November and December): North- East monsoon or post monsoon season is a
transition season associated with the establishment of the north-easterly wind regime over the
Indian sub continent. Meteorological subdivisions of coastal Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala
and South Interior Karnataka receive good amounts of rainfall accounting for about 35 percent
of their annual total rainfall in these months. Many parts of this region are affected due to the
storms forming in the Bay of Bengal. Large scale losses to life and property occur due to heavy
rainfall, strong winds and storm surges in the coastal region.

Disaster Management in India

1.9 Cause and Effect of Disasters6
1.9.1 India is vulnerable to extreme weather events (Box 1.2). Over the decade of the 1990s,
both the number and severity of such events have increased. Weather events can be classified
as extreme on the basis of various factors such as the impact, the socio-economic losses,
environmental degradation and long term damages etc.
1.9.2 With more than 70 percent of India’s population relying on agriculture directly or indirectly,
the impact of extreme weather on human life and other living beings. is critical. In the state of
Orissa, 49 years have experienced floods, 30 have had droughts, and 11 faced cyclones. These
analyses have yielded a 30-year cyclicity of the Indian monsoons. Droughts were more common
in the 1960s. Of the 14 major drought years in the 85-year record, eight occurred in the first
30 year period (1891-1920) whereas there was only one in the second 30 year period (19211950). In the 25-year period from 1951 –1981, five major drought years were recorded. In 1972
and 1979 deficient rainfall (about 25% below normal) was recorded in one half to two thirds of
India’s plains. In 1994, monsoon rainfall was deficient (between 20% and 43%) in 10 of the 31
meteorological subdivisions of India.
1.9.3 According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), data of major natural disasters/
extremes that occurred around the world during the period 1963-2002, indicates that floods and
droughts cause the maximum damage as shown in Table 1.6.

1.9.4 Floods and droughts occurring in India are closely associated with the nature and extent
of the summer monsoon. The inter-annual fluctuations in the summer monsoon rainfall over
India are sufficiently large to cause devastating floods or serious droughts. Floods and droughts
affect vast areas of the country, transcending state boundaries. One-sixth area of the country is
drought-prone. Out of 40 million hectares of the flood prone area in the country, on an average,
floods affect an area of around 7.5 million hectares per year.

1.10 Droughts7
The primary cause of any drought is deficiency of rainfall and in particular, the timing, distribution
and intensity of this deficiency in relation to existing reserves. A prolonged period of relatively
dry weather leading to drought is a widely recognized climate anomaly. Drought can be
devastating as water supplies dry up, crops fail to grow, animals die, and malnutrition and ill
health become widespread The environmental effects of drought, including stalinization of soil
and groundwater decline, increased pollution of freshwater ecosystems and regional extinction
of animal species. The details of the drought years may be seen from the Table 1.7.

In India around 68 percent of the country is prone to drought in varying degrees. Of the entire
area 35 percent receives rain falls between 750 mm and 1125 mm which is considers drought
prone while 33 percent which receives rainfalls between less than 750 mm is considered to be
chronically drought prone.

1.11. Floods8
1.11.1 Flood destructions have always brought miseries to numerous people, especially in
rural areas. Flood results in the outbreak of serious epidemics, specially malaria and cholera.
Simultaneously, scarcity of water also arises. It has a drastic effect on agricultural produce.
Sometimes, water remains standing over large areas for long span of time hampering the Rabi
crops. The flood hazard map of India may be seen in the Figure 1.11.
1.11.2 India is one of the most flood prone countries in the world. The principal reasons for flood
lie in the very nature of natural ecological systems in this country, namely, the monsoon, the
highly silted river systems and the steep and highly erodible mountains, particularly those of the
Himalayan ranges. The average rainfall in India is 1150 mm with significant variation across the
country. The annual rainfall along the western coast and Western Ghats, Khasi hills and over most
of the Brahmaputra valley amounts to more than 2500 mm. Most of the floods occur during the
monsoon period and are usually associated with tropical storms or depressions, active monsoon
conditions and break monsoon situations.
1.11.3 Twenty-three of the 35 states and union territories in the country are subject to floods and 40
million hectares of land, roughly one-eighth of the country’s geographical area, is prone to floods.
The National Flood Control Program was launched in the country in 1954. Since then sizeable
progress has been made in the flood protection measures. By 1976, nearly one third of the flood
prone area had been afforded reasonable protection; considerable experience has been gained in
planning, implementation and performance of flood warning, protection and control measures
(CWC, 2007). Table 1.8 presents the flood affected area and damages for the period 1953 to 2004 in
India as per Water Data Complete Book 2005 and Central Water Commission, 2007).

1.11.4 Floods occur in almost all rivers basins in India. The main causes of floods are heavy rainfall,
inadequate capacity of rivers to carry the high flood discharge, inadequate drainage to carry
away the rainwater quickly to streams/ rivers. Ice jams or landslides blocking streams; typhoons
and cyclones also cause floods. Flash floods occur due to high rate of water flow as also due
to poor permeability of the soil. Areas with hardpan just below the surface of the soil are more
prone to, floods as water fails to seep down to the deeper layers.

20

An Overview

Floods in Uttarakhand in September 2010

1.11.5 Vulnerability to floods and other natural disasters is caused by the high population density,
widespread poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, enormous pressure on rural land, and an economy
traditionally dominated by agriculture. Children and women are particularly vulnerable. Eightyfive percent of the deaths during disasters are of women and children (Centre for Research on
the Epidemiology of Disasters, CRED 2000). Presently there is an inadequate level of protection in
the country against floods. Though non-structural measures improve the preparedness to floods
and reduce losses, the necessity of structural measures would always remain to reduce the extent
of physical damage caused by floods. In future, programme, flood control and management
planning along with climate change need to be integrated into development planning for the
country.

1.12 Tropical Cyclones9
1.12.1 The major natural disaster that affects the coastal regions of India is cyclone and as India has
a coastline of about 7516 kms, it is exposed to nearly 10 percent of the world’s tropical cyclones.
About 71 percent of this area is in ten states (Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil
Nadu, Puducherry, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal). The islands of Andaman, Nicobar and
Lakshadweep are also prone to cyclones. On an average, about five or six tropical cyclones form in
the Bay of Bengal and Arabian sea and hit the coast every year. Out of these, two or three are severe.
1.12.2 When a cyclone approaches to coast, a risk of serious loss or damage arises from
severe winds, heavy rainfall, storm surges and river floods. The effect of a storm surge is most
pronounced in wide and shallow bays exposed to cyclones such as in the northern part of Bay
of Bengal. On an average, five or six tropical cyclones occur every year, of which two or three
could be severe. Most cyclones occur in the Bay of Bengal followed by those in the Arabian Sea
and the ratio is approximately 4:1. The incidence of cyclonic storms, with wind speeds between
65 Km/h and 117 Km/h and severe cyclonic storm with wind speeds between 119 Km/h and 164

Km/h, reaching Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh is high during the north east monsoon season
ie. October – December, where as the highest annual number of storms, severe storms occur in
the Orissa - West Bengal coast.
1.12.3 The yearly distribution of tropical cyclones in the north Indian Ocean indicates large yearto-year variations in the frequency of cyclonic disturbances and tropical cyclones, but no distinct
periodicity. However, the trend indicates a slight decrease with time. The annual average of
cyclonic disturbances in the North Indian Ocean is about 15.7 with a standard deviation of 3.1.
The annual number of cyclonic disturbances range from seven in 1984 to twenty three in 1927.
The annual average of tropical cyclones has varied from one in 1949 to ten in 1893, 1926, 1930
and 1976. The Cyclone hazard map of India may be seen in the Figure 1.12. gives the vulnerability
map of hazard due to cyclone.
1.12.4 A severe super cyclonic storm with winds of upto 250 km/hour crossed the coast in Orissa
on October 29, 1999. This may have been the worst cyclone of the country in the Orissa region
and was responsible for as many as 10,000 deaths, rendering millions homeless and extensive
damage to property and environment. Some of the disastrous tropical storms of India and
Bangladesh are given in Table 1.9.

mortality and discomfort. Increased minimum temperatures in summer do not allow the
necessary nocturnal cooling to neutralize the high maximum temperature during a heat wave
epoch. Table 1.11 gives the details of the death due to the heat waves in India.

1.14 Cold Wave and Fog11
1.14.1 Occurrences of extreme low temperature in association with incursion of dry cold
winds from north into the sub continent are known as cold waves. The northern parts of India,
specially the hilly regions and the adjoining plains, are influenced by transient disturbances
in the mid latitude westerlies which often have weak frontal characteristics. These are known
as western disturbances. The cold waves mainly affect the areas to the north of 20°N but in
association with large amplitude troughs, cold wave conditions are sometimes reported
from states like Maharashtra and Karnataka as well. Table 1.12 gives the frequencies of the
occurrence of cold waves in different parts of the country for different periods. In recent years
due to deterioration of the air quality in urban locations of India the deaths and discomfort
from cold waves have been substantial. UP and Bihar rank the highest in terms of casualties
from cold wave and this could be due to poor level of development and lack of shelters to the
outdoor workers and farmers.

1.15 Thunderstorm, Hailstorm and Dust Storm12
1.15.1 As winter season transforms into spring, the temperature rises initially in
the southern parts of India, giving rise to thunderstorms and squally weather which are
hazardous in nature. While the southernmost part of the country is free from dust storms and
hailstorms, such hazardous weather affects the central, northeastern, north and northwestern
parts of the country. The hailstorm frequencies are highest in the Assam valley, followed by
hills of Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Vidarbha Maharashtra (Philip & Daniel 1976). However,
thunderstorms also occur in Kolkatta, Delhi, Jaipur and Ahmedabad. Tornadoes are rare in
India but some of them are quite devastating. Some of other tornadoes which caused extensive
damage and destruction in the country is given in the Table 1.13.

1.16 Earthquakes13
1.16.1 Globally, earthquakes result in a loss of about 50,000 lives every year. Earthquakes over 5.5
magnitude on the Richter scale are progressively damaging to property and human life. However,
there are many other factors that influences the damage pattern. Massive earthquakes generally
occur near the junction of two tectonic plates, e.g., along the Himalayan range, where the Indian
plate goes below Eurasian plate. The Indian sub- continent situated on the boundaries of two
continental plates is very prone to earthquakes. Some of the most intense earthquakes of the
world have occurred in India. Fortunately, none of these have occurred in any of the major cities.
According to latest seismic zoning map brought out by the Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS), over
65 percent of the country is prone to earthquake of intensity Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale
(MSK) VII or more.
1.16.2 India has been divided into four seismic zones according to the maximum intensity of
earthquake expected (Figure 1.13). Of these, zone V is the most active which comprises of whole
of Northeast India, the northern portion of Bihar, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, J&K, Gujarat
and Andaman & Nicobar Islands. India has highly populous cities and the constructions in these
cities are not earthquake resistant. Regulatory mechanisms are weak, thus any earthquake
striking in one of these cities would turn into a major disaster. Six major earthquakes have struck
different parts of India over a span of the last 15 years.
1.16.3 The entire Himalayan Region is considered to be vulnerable to high intensity earthquakes
of a magnitude exceeding 8.0 on the Richter Scale, and in a relatively short span of about 50 years,
four such major earthquakes have occurred in the region: Shillong, 1897 (M8.7); Kangra, 1905

An Overview

1.17 Landslides14
1.17.1 Landslides mainly affect the Himalayan region and the western ghats of India. Landslides
are also common in the Nilgiri range. It is estimated that 30 percent of the world’s landslides
occur in the Himalayas. The Himalayan mountains, which constitute the youngest and most
dominating mountain system in the world, are not a single long landmass but comprises a series
of seven curvilinear parallel folds running along a grand arc for a total of 3400 kilometers. Due
to its unique nature, the Himalayas have a history of landslides that has no comparison with any
other mountain range in the world. Landslides are also common in western ghat. In the Nilgiris,
in 1978 alone, unprecedented rains in the region triggered about one hundred landslides which
caused severe damage to communication lines, tea gardens and other cultivated crops. A valley
in Nilgiris is called “Avalanches Valley”. Scientific observation in north Sikkim and Garhwal regions
in the Himalayas clearly reveal that there is an average of two landslides per sq. km. The mean
rate of land loss is to the tune of 120 meter per km per year and annual soil loss is about 2500
tones per sq km. Fig 1.14 shows the landslide hazard zones in India
1.17.2 Landslides constitute a major natural hazard in our country, which accounts for
considerable loss of life and damage to communication routes, human settlements, agricultural
fields and forest lands. Based on the general experience with landslides, a rough estimate of
monetary loss is of the order of ` 100 crore to ` 150 crore per annum at the current prices for
the country as a whole.

1.18 Industrial and Chemical Disasters15
1.18.1 Industrial disasters include events that occur due to mishaps or failures in industry
or related activities and also the disasters that affect the industrial functions, property and
productivity. ‘Chemical Disasters’ and ‘Industrial Disasters’ are terms often used interchangeably
but are actually a sub-category of the other. A chemical disaster may occur due to both, natural or
human-made sources, however, in view of growing chemical usage and industrial development
worldwide, the pre-disaster prevention and mitigation of chemical (industrial) disasters is a

An Overview
serious concern. It is estimated that there are currently over 1949 Major Accident Hazards units
in India besides other small and medium–sized industries, in huge numbers, all across the nation.
New industries are also coming up at a rapid rate. A year wise list of chemical disasters for past
decade may be seen in Table 1.15.
1.18.2 Industrial disaster: Industrial disasters are disasters caused by chemical, mechanical, civil,
electrical or other process failures due to accident, negligence or incompetence, in an industrial
plant which may spill over to the areas outside the plant or with in causing damage to life,
property and environment.
1.18.3 Chemical disaster: Chemical disasters are occurrence of emission, fire or explosion
involving one or more hazardous chemicals in the course of industrial activity (handling),
storage or transportation or due to natural events leading to serious effects inside or outside the
installation likely to cause loss of life and property including adverse effects on the environment.
“Chemical accident or emergency can result in extensive damage to the environment with
considerable human and economic costs. Chemical and industrial emergencies may arise in a
number of ways, such as • Explosion in a plant
• Accidents in storage facilities of chemicals
• Accidents during the transportation of
chemicals, misuse of chemicals
• Improper waste management

• Accidents in treatment plants
• Technological system failures
• Failures of plant safety design
• Arson and sabotage
• Human error

1.19 Tsunami
1.19.1 Tsunamis and earthquakes happen after centuries of energy build up within the
earth. A tsunami (in Japanese ‘tsu’ means harbor and ‘nami’ means wave) is a series of water
waves caused by the displacement of a large volume of a body of water, usually an ocean.
In the Tamil language it is known as “Aazhi Peralai”. Seismicity generated tsunamis are result
of abrupt deformation of sea floor resulting vertical displacement of the overlying water.
Earthquakes occurring beneath the sea level, the water above the reformed area is displaced
from its equilibrium position. The release of energy produces tsunami waves which have small
amplitude but a very long wavelength (often hundreds of kilometer long). It may be caused by
non-seismic event also such as a landslide or impact of a meteor.
1.19.2 Characteristics: Tsunami in the deep ocean may have very long waves length of
hundred of kilometer and travels at about 800 km per hour, but an amplitude of only about
1 km. It remains undetected by ships in the deep sea. However when it approaches the coast
its wavelength diminishes but amplitude
grows enormously, and it takes very little Box 1. 3: Historical Tsunamis in India

Box 1. 4: Tsunami in Indian Ocean
The Tsunami of 26th December 2004 caused extensive damage to life and property in the states of Tamil
Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, UTs of Puducherry and Andman & Nicobar Islands (A & NI). The Tsunami
disaster had badly affected the fishermen community who not only lost their near and dear ones but
also lost their means of livelihood. A population of 26.63 lakhs in 1396 villages in five states and UTs was
affected by this disaster. Almost 9395 people lost their lives and 3964 people were reported missing and
feared dead. Most of the missing persons were from Andaman & Nicobar Islands.

1.19.4 Tsunami Risk Assessment17: A preliminary risk assessment has been done for the Indian
Coast w.r.t. tsunamis taking into account the seismo-tectonic setting, historical seismicity and
past tsunami events. The east and west coasts of India and the island regions are likely to be
affected by Tsunamis generated mainly by subduction zone related earthquakes from the
two potential source regions, viz., the Andaman-Nicobar-Sumatra Island Arc and the Makran
subduction zone north of Arabian Sea.
Depending upon the location of the Earthquake, the response time for evacuation of coastal
population could range between 10 minutes to a few hours (Figure 1.16). Tsunami modeling
studies indicate that the least response time available is for the Andaman & Nicobar Islands which
are situated right on the subduction zones capable of triggering tsunamigenic earthquakes.
Considering that a credible worst case earthquake of 7.5 or higher occurs near Nicobar, the

33

34

An Overview
travel time to the nearest coast in Nicobar would be approximately 20 – 30 minutes and for the
Indian mainland about 2 – 3 hours. For earthquakes occurring near Indonesia, the travel time to
Andaman & Nicobar would be in the range of 1 – 2 hours and to the Indian mainland about 3 – 5
hours. For earthquakes occurring off Makran, the travel time to the nearest Indian coast (Gujarat)
would be about 2 – 3 hours. A table showing typical travel times of tsunami waves to a few Indian
Coastal locations for 4 historic events is illustrated in Table 1.16.

Box 1.5: Cascading effect of Disaster – Earthquake, Tsunami, fire and nuclear disaster: Japan
Experience16
Event of one kind of Disaster sometimes
lead to a cascading effect and untold
other disasters. The preparedness to
respond to such unforeseen chain of
events is difficult to visualize and plan
and is going to be one of the challenges
to managers engaged in DRR. Recent
experiences of earthquake in Japan
leading to Tsunami, fire and then
nuclear emergency are an eye opener
to those underestimating the might
and fury of nature.

Earthquake
On 11th March 2011, at 14:46 the
northeastern part of Japan was
triggered by a major earthquake
of magnitude 9 with an epicenter
at 130 km off the pacific coast
of Tohoku region and depth of

Disaster Management in India

24 km. As per the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the seismic intensity of 7[in the Japanese
scale of 1 to 7] was recorded in Kurihara city of Miyagi prefecture. Moreover, the intensity of 6+
was recorded in 28 cities and towns in Miyagi, Fukushima, Ibaraki, and Tochigi prefacture. It also
included Wakuya town, Tome city and Osaki city. Intensity of 6 or weaker was observed in different
parts of the country.
ii.

Tsunami
It was followed by a major Tsunami, with maximum height of 11.87 meter recorded near the coast
of Akamae at 15:31 JST, Major tsunami of more than 3 m or more arrived in northern part of Japan:
eastern, central, western part of pacific coast of Hokkaido, Pacific coast of Aomori, Iwate, Miyagi,
Fukushima, Ibaraki, Chiba prefecture, Kujukuri, & Sotoboare and Izu islands. The earthquake in
Japan also triggered warning in other countries such as Taiwan, Indonesia, Russia, Philippines,
the pacific Islands, and as far away as Hawaii, Mexico and Colombia. The earthquake happened in
14:46, and the tsunami warning was issued at 14:49, and it was on the JMA website on 14:49.
The hypo-central region of this earthquake extends from offshore Iwate prefecture to offshore
Ibaraki prefecture so that the most effected area were Iwate prefecture, Myagi prefecture,
Fukushima prefecture and Ibaraki prefecture The Japanese Meteorological Agency said that the
earthquake may have ruptured the fault zone from Iwate to Ibaraki with a length of 500 km and a
width of 200 km.
Following the 9.0 magnitude earthquake, massive waves of debris-filled water swept away
buildings, cars, and ships. Fires occurred in several cities and nuclear power plants, refineries,
airports, and parts of the transport networks were shut down.
As of 23rd March, the resulted death was nearly 9,079, and 12,782 missing. The disaster also damaged
126,000 buildings, besides damaging other infrastructure, such as bridges, transportation system,

electricity, gas supplies, and communication services. Citigroup expects 5-10 trillion yen in
damage to housing and infrastructure, while Barclays Capital estimates economic losses of 15
trillion yen ($183.7 billion) or 3 percent of Japan’s GDP.
iii.

Fire Events
On 11th March, several fires’ resulted due to powerful earthquake triggered near the east coast
of Honshu, the largest and main island of Japan. Fire broke out at Cosmo Oil Company refinery in
Ichihara city. The fire continued till 14th March. The number of events increased after the first day
of earthquake, when only 44 cases were recorded. It increased to 325 cases on 19th March.

iv.

Nuclear Emergency
Same day at 20:30 CET (04:30 JST), a nuclear emergency situation at the Fukushima Daiichi
(number one) nuclear power plant was declared. Because of the intense earthquake all the three
operating (out of six) reactors automatically began the process to be shut down. The back-up
diesel generators for supplying the water to cool down the fuel rods inside the reactors due to the
tsunami were damaged. The water available began to evaporate and at 15:30 JST on March 12 a
first hydrogen explosion took place at the number one reactor and led the Japanese government
to evacuate people within a 20 km radius around the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. On March
14 at 11:01 JST, another explosion took place in reactor number 3 at the Fukushima Daiichi
nuclear power plant. At 06:14 JST on March 15, another explosion took place in the number
2 reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. And a fire broke out in the number 4
reactor where spent fuel rods were stored to undergo their cooling process, soon after the fire
was extinguished. These incidents led to further increase of emission of radiation with levels up
to 400 millisievert per hour near the site. (A person is normally not to be exposed to more than

2.4 millisivert per year!) Subsequently, the Japanese Government established a 30km radius “No
Fly Zone” around the Fukhushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. On March 17, the helicopters’ water
spraying supported by further units of the Self Defense Force (SDF) shot water from the ground,
using heavy water cannon trucks, into the most troubled number 3 reactor which continued the
following days. Meanwhile new power cables were installed to provide the reactors number 1 and
2 with energy to start-up again the cooling mechanisms. Increased radiation levels were reported
in spinach, milk and tap water outside the demarcated 30km evacuation zone. Farmers were
advised to voluntarily avoid distributing contaminated food into the markets.
V.

Lessons
This recent event is a pointer to the need to have a multi-hazard approach and plan to handle
unexpected disasters. Japan as a country is one of the best prepared countries, yet had to face the
cascading impact of disasters starting from the large undersea earthquake, resultant Tsunami, fire
and nuclear and energy related emergencies in addition to the disaster linked loss of life, livelihood
assets etc.

1.20 Stampede18
The term stampede is applied to a sudden rush of a crowd of people, usually resulting in many
injuries and death from suffocation and trampling. In stampede, the term mob or crowd is used
to refer to a congregated, active, polarized aggregate of people, which is basically heterogeneous
and complex. Its most salient features include homogeneity of thought and action among its
participants and their impulsive and irrational actions.
1.20.1 Causes: Incidents of stampedes can occur in numerous socio-cultural situations. These
stampede incidents can be categorized into the following types, where the causes and the
impact are described in the incident. Though the list is not exhaustive, it provides a fair idea
about various types of situations where stampedes can occur.
• Entertainment events

• Power failure

• Escalator and moving walkways

• Religious events

• Food distribution

• Fire incidents during religious/other events

• Processions

• Riots

• Natural disasters

• Sports events
• Weather related

1.21. Nuclear Emergencies

19

1.21.1 Nuclear emergency /Disaster is caused due to an extraordinary release of radioactive
material or radiation either in the operation of nuclear reactors or other nuclear events like
explosion of a Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD) or Improvised Nuclear Device (IND) or
explosion of a nuclear weapon. It is accompanied with sudden release of harmful radiations or
radioactive materials or both together in to the environment.
(i) Nuclear emergency may be encountered in the following situations: Intentional use of
nuclear weapons in the event of war: Nuclear attacks may make use of nuclear weapons,
which are extremely destructive and powerful enough to destroy an entire city. With
the advancement of scientific research in the world, several countries have acquired the
technology to produce nuclear weapons, which are more destructive and harmful than
the atom bomb used more than half a century ago against Japan during the Second World
War.
(ii) Accidents in nuclear power project: The nuclear Power Plants take care of safety by Engineered
safety features by design and redundancy in safety systems to prevent any mal-operations
and to bring the system to a safe shut down in case of any abnormalities. However, in case
of a major malfunction, there is a remote possibility of release of radioactivity/ radiation to
the environment. The area affected would depend on the amount of the release, and wind
direction, speed and weather conditions.
(iii) Accidents in handling radiation sources :Other accidental exposure of radiation could be
due to accident with the radioactive material during transportation, wrong/faulty practices,
failure of machinery of a radiation facility etc. A brief summary of the accidents between
1987 to 2010 are given in Table 1.18.

In a radiological accident, an irradiator was sold
to metal scrap dealer. The dealer dismantled the
irradiator which caused release of radioactive source
resulting the exposure to a worker in the shop leads
to one fatality
Source: Babha Automic Research Centre, Mumbai

1.21.3 Radiation releases due to any reason can be devastating - Chernobyl is a good example.
With modern reactor design, a catastrophic release of radiation is highly unlikely, but nevertheless,
possible. This can happen due to factors beyond the control of the operating agencies e.g.,
human error, system failure, sabotage, earthquake, cyclone, flood and tsunami etc.

1.22 Road Accidents18
1.22.1 The rapid expansion of road transport has brought with it the challenge of addressing
adverse factors such as the increase in road accidents. Road accidents are a human tragedy. It
involves high human suffering and monetary costs in terms of premature deaths, injuries, loss of
productivity etc. Most deaths and injuries due to road accidents are invisible to society. They are
a hidden epidemic. In India, motor vehicles including two wheelers are growing at a faster rate
then the economic and population growth.
1.22.2 Global Status Report on Road Safety (WHO, 2009) has estimated that 1.2 million people
die on the world’s road every year, and as many as 50 million others are injured. Over 90% of
deaths occurred in low income and middle income countries, which have only 48% of the world’s
registered vehicles. The problem of road safety is acute in India. In the year 2008 alone, number
of road accidents were 4.8 lakh resulting in close to 1.2 lakh deaths and 5.2 lakh injured, many
of whom are disabled for rest of their lives. Sadly, many of these victims are economically active
young people.

41

Disaster Management in India
1.22.3 Trends in accidents, injuries, fatalities, motor vehicles & road network: Between 1970
and 2008, the number of accidents quadrupled with more than 7 fold increase in injuries and
more than 8 fold increase in fatalities in the backdrop of about 64 fold increase in the number of
registered motor vehicles and threefold increase in road network.
1.22.4 Profile of road accidents: The proportion of fatal accidents in the total road accidents has
consistently increased since 2001 as reflected in Table 1.19 and 1.20. The severity of road
accidents measured in terms of persons killed per 100 accidents is observed to have increased
from less than 20 in 2001 to 24.7 in 2008.

1.22.7 International Comparisons of Road Traffic Injury, Accidents and Deaths: Cross
country comparisons of incidence of road accident related deaths and injury accidents
per lakh persons as per World Road Statistics 2009 (published by International Road
Federation, Geneva) shows lower incidence of both the parameters for India in comparison to
many developed and developing countries. The number of road accident deaths per lakh of
population at 10.5 in India was much lower compared with 12.72 in Korea and 13.68 in USA.
Similarly, injury accidents per lakh of population for both in India and China were substantially
lower at around 36.69 and 24.82 respectively when compared to U.K. (298.54), USA (579.68),
France (131.75), Germany (408.23).

1.23 Rail Accidents21
1.23.1 Based on the definition of the Disaster Management Act 2005, Ministry of Railways has
adopted the following definition on Railway Disaster: “Railway Disaster is a serious train accident
or an untoward event of grave nature, either on railway premises or arising out of railway activity,
due to natural or human-made causes, that may lead to loss of many lives and /or grievous injuries to
a large number of people, and/or severe disruption of traffic etc, necessitating large scale help from
other government/non-government and private organizations.”
1.23.2 Nodal Department for policy Formulation on DM on Indian Railways: The preparation
of Disaster Management Plan on Indian railways and on the Zonal Railways in coordination with
the different Departments of the Railway, other Central/State Govt. agencies, NGOs, private
agencies, etc. has to be done by the Safety Department in the railway Board, on the Zonal Railway
and Divisions. Railway Board has approved the nomination of GMs, AGMs or CSOs (when GM/
AGM is not available) for declaring an untoward incident as a Railway Disaster.
1.23.4 Train accident analysis: The statistics of the death and injured in the consequential train
accidents during the last ten years are given in Table 1.22:

There is a visible decreasing trend in rail accidents and deaths from the year 1999-2009 as shown
in Figure 1.20. It shows that there is a better preparedness and latest technologies has helped in
reducing the train accidents and subsequent deaths.

1.24 Air Accidents22
1.24.1 Air accidents are by and large of four types; mid-air collisions, forced landings, crash due
to technical snags and air-crash in mountainous terrain due to poor visibility. While air accidents
can occur at any time and at any place, areas within about 30 – 40 kms. radius of airports are
most vulnerable. Experience shows that a majority of air accidents occur either during take-off
or landing near major airports where flight paths get congested. In addition, air accidents also
take place at remote inaccessible places like forests, hilly and mountainous regions, high seas,
etc. Accidents to Indian Civil Registered Aircraft from 1990 to 2000 may be seen in Table 1.23.
1.24.2 Causes: Causes of air accidents are either human failure of pilots, air traffic controllers
or technical failures of on board, landing instruments. In rare cases, it may also be the result of
terrorist activities.

1.25 Mine Disasters23
1.25.1 Mines Act, 1965 defines Disaster as an act Accident (unexpect event) causing loss of more
than 10 lives. A mining accident is an accident that occurs in the process of mining minerals.
The Act categories an accident involving loss of lives less than 10 major accident. Thousands of
miners die from mining accidents each year, especially in the process of coal mining and hard
rock mining. One of the greatest mining disasters in Indian mines occurred on 27 December
1975 due to water in rush from old abandoned incline working to a deep shaft mine working of
Chasnallah Colliery leading to death of 375 miners.
1.25.2 Following types of mining disasters, losses and impacts are classified by the DGMS.
• Side fall (slope failure) disaster in opencast mines,

• Accident due to electricity,

• Roof and side falls in underground mines,

• Mine fires,

• Collapse of mine pillars,

• Accidents due to explosive,

• Air Blast,

• Inundations,

• Failure of rope haulage,

• Explosions in mines.
• Rock burst and bumps,

1.25.4 The details of disasters involving 10 or more fatalities in both coal & Non coal mines in
India are given in the Table 1.24 and 1.25.

An Overview
Mining accidents can have a variety of causes, including leaks of poisonous gases such as
methane or explosive natural gas called firedamp, asphyxiant gases, dust explosions, collapsing
of mine stops, flooding or general mechanical errors from improperly used or malfunctioning of
mining equipment.
1.25.5 A statistical analysis of major mining accidents (more than four fatalities) in 1901-2010
(Table 1.26.) revealed that about 334 numbers of incidences caused 3672 fatalities.

1.26 Epidemics in India

24

1.26.1 Infectious diseases are a major public health problem in India. While many infectious
diseases like tuberculosis and malaria are endemic, some of them occasionally attain epidemic
proportion. An epidemic refers to an increase, often sudden, in number of cases of a disease
in a community clearly in excess of what is normally expected in that population. Epidemics
are public health emergencies which disrupt routine health services and are major drain
on resources. Epidemics include viral infections disease (mengitis, measles, dengue, polio,
typhoid fever etc.) and Bacterial infectious diseases (cholera, diarrheoa etc.) The main causes
for epidemic are non availability of clean and hygienic drinking water contamination of
drinking water sources, lack of awareness about sanitation, unhygienic food, overcrowding,
biological conditions in addition to ecological factors. Besides direct costs in epidemic control
measures and treatment of patients, the indirect costs due to negative impact on domestic
and international tourism and trade can be significant. For example, plague which was not
reported from any part of India for almost a quarter of century, caused a major outbreak in
Beed district in Maharashtra and Surat in Gujarat in 1994 and resulted in an estimated loss of
almost US$ 1.7 billion.
1.26.2 Several factors related to microbes, environment and host susceptibility contribute to
the occurrence of epidemics. Because of prevalence of these factors, developing countries
including India are frequently affected by epidemics/ outbreaks which result in high morbidity
and mortality and affect the public health and economy adversely. Outbreaks reported by
States under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) during the period 2008-2010
are shown in Table 1.27.

1.26.3 As shown in the Table 1.27, most of the outbreaks/epidemics reported in India are due to
water-borne diseases, vector-borne diseases and vaccine preventable diseases. While National
Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme (NVBDCP) is the key programme for prevention/
control of outbreak of epidemics of malaria, dengue, chikungunya etc, vaccines administered
under UIP/EPI reduce the morbidity and mortality due to diseases like measles, diphtheria,
pertussis, poliomyelitis etc. Availability of safe water and adoption of personal and domestic
hygienic practices are important measures to prevent/control epidemics of water-borne diseases
like cholera, viral hepatitis etc.

1.27 Deaths due to Unnatural Cause25
1.27.1 A comparative list prepared by National Crime Record Bureau, MHA for year 2008 and 2009
in respect of death due to unnatural cause have been given in Table 1.28, which would show the
enormity of problems leading to such deaths which attracts little attention due to their sporadic
nature and such calamity happening in a diffused manner and not in one event generally.

1.27.2 Analysis of deaths due to Accidents: Accidents - human-made and natural - are among
the two most important reasons of pre-mature end to human lives. Injuries resulting from
the accidents handicap many people. These unfortunate victims are important members of
their families as well as of the society. This way, the loss due to accidents and suicides is felt
by family members and society at large. The deep and wide impact of accidents and suicides
make it incumbent upon society to make efforts at reducing the incidence of these phenomena.
Appropriate intervention measures can be devised only after studying various facets of these
phenomena. Detailed data is a sine qua non for any study. While individual disaster and event
data maintained by the states and reported to the GOI may not accurately tally with the

52

An Overview

Figure 1.21: Unnatural deaths in 2009- Causes, Number and as a percentage of the Total deaths
(357,021)

Source: National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB)

NCRB report as some are maintained calendar year wise and some financial year wise yet the
NCRB collected data is a useful data for analysis. This data on accidental deaths due to causes
attributable to nature - such as cyclone / tornado, earthquake, flood, landslide and torrential
rains, to name a few - as well as those not attributable to nature - for example, explosion, fire,
sudden deaths, stampede, traffic accidents and others are revealing. These may be seen from
the Figure 1.21. Accidental deaths due to natural causes were 6.2 % and those due to unnatural
causes were 93.8% and traffic accidents account for the maximum deaths. These trends are a
cause of concern for every class of the society, especially to policy makers principally for two
reasons. Firstly, the Government is committed for improving the living conditions of its citizens
and Secondly, the loss of these lives results in irreparable damage to the society.

1.28 Conclusion
A series of catastrophes across the world in recent times have served as a reminder and backdrop
of the chapters following the overview which is an attempt to capture valuable and available
information across sectors and departments with focus on disaster management. It is hoped
that the information will serve as a tool to improve the roles and capacities of all the stakeholders
while facing the hazards, risks and the resultant disasters.

Disaster Management in India

54

Institutional
Framework

2.1 Evolution of Disaster Management in India
Disaster management in India has evolved from an activity-based reactive setup to a proactive
institutionalized structure; from single faculty domain to a multi-stakeholder setup; and from a
relief-based approach to a ‘multi-dimensional pro-active holistic approach for reducing risk’. The
beginnings of an institutional structure for disaster management can be traced to the British
period following the series of disasters such as famines of 1900, 1905, 1907 & 1943, and the
Bihar-Nepal earthquake of 1937. Over the past century, the disaster management in India has
undergone substantive changes in its composition, nature and policy.

2.2 Disaster Management during British Administration and Post Independence
During the British administration, relief departments were set up for emergencies during
disasters. Such an activity-based setup with a reactive approach was functional only in the postdisaster scenarios. The policy was relief-oriented and activities included designing the relief
codes and initialising food for work programmes. Post-Independence, the task for managing
disasters continued to rest with the Relief Commissioners in each state, who functioned under
the Central Relief Commissioner, with their role limited to delegation of relief material and money
in the affected areas. Every five-year plan addressed flood disasters under “Irrigation, Command
Area Development and Flood Control”. Until this stage, the disaster management structure was
activity-based, functioning under the Relief Departments.

2.3 Emergence of Institutional Arrangement in India
A permanent and institutionalised setup began in the decade of 1990s with set up of a disaster
management cell under the Ministry of Agriculture, following the declaration of the decade of
1990 as the ‘International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction’ (IDNDR) by the UN General
Assembly. Following series of disasters such as Latur Earthquake (1993), Malpa Landslide (1994),
Orissa Super Cyclone (1999) and Bhuj Earthquake (2001), a high powered Committee under the
Chairmanship of Mr. J.C. Pant, Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture was constituted for drawing
up a systematic, comprehensive and holistic approach towards disasters. There was a shift in
policy from an approach of relief through financial aid to a holistic one for addressing disaster
management. Consequently, the disaster management division was shifted under the Ministry
of Home Affairs in 2002 vide Cabinet Secretariat’s Notification No. DOC.CD-108/2002 dated
27/02/2002 and a hierarchical structure for disaster management evolved in India.

2.4 Organisation and Structure of Disaster Management
The Disaster Management Division is headed by Joint Secretary (DM) in MHA, who is assisted by
three Directors, Under Secretaries, Section Officers, Technical Officer, Senior Economic Investigator
consultants and other supporting staff. The upper echelon of the structure consists of Secretary
(Border Management), Home Secretary, Minister of State in charge and the Home Minister.

2.5 Disaster Management Framework
Shifting from relief and response mode, disaster management in India started to address the
issues of early warning systems, forecasting and monitoring setup for various weather related
hazards. A structure for flow of information, in the form of warnings, alerts and updates about
the oncoming hazard, also emerged within this framework. A multi-stakeholder High powered
group was setup by involving representatives from different ministries and departments.
Some of these ministries were also designated as the nodal authorities for specific disasters.

55

Disaster Management in India
Following a High Powered Committee Report on Disaster Management for establishment of
a separate institutional structure for addressing disasters and enactment of a suitable law
for institutionalizing disaster management in the country, a multi-level links between these
ministries and the disaster management framework have emerged. Disaster Management
framework may be seen in Figure 2.8.

2.6 Present Structure for Disaster Management in India
2.6.1 The institutional structure for disaster management in India is in a state of transition. The
new setup, following the implementation of the Act, is evolving; while the previous structure
also continues (Figure 2.1). Thus, the two structures co-exist at present. The National Disaster
Management Authority has been established at the centre, and the SDMA at state and district
authorities at district level are gradually being formalized. In addition to this, the National Crisis
Management Committee, part of the earlier setup, also functions at the Centre. The nodal
ministries, as identified for different disaster types of function under the overall guidance of the
Ministry of Home Affairs (nodal ministry for disaster management). This makes the stakeholders
interact at different levels within the disaster management framework.
2.6.2 Within this transitional and evolving setup, two distinct features of the institutional structure
for disaster management may be noticed. Firstly, the structure is hierarchical and functions at
four levels – centre, state, district and local. In both the setups – one that existed prior to the
implementation of the Act, and other that is being formalized post-implementation of the Act,
there have existed institutionalized structures at the centre, state, district and local levels. Each
preceding level guides the activities and decision making at the next level in hierarchy. Secondly,
it is a multi-stakeholder setup, i.e., the structure draws involvement of various relevant ministries,

2.7 Disaster Management Act, 2005
2.7.1 This Act provides for the effective management of disaster and for matters connected
therewith or incidental thereto. It provides institutional mechanisms for drawing up and
monitoring the implementation of the disaster management. The Act also ensures measures by
the various wings of the Government for prevention and mitigation of disasters and prompt
response to any disaster situation.
2.7.2 The Act provides for setting up of a National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) under
the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister, State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs) under
the Chairmanship of the Chief Ministers, District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMAs)
under the Chairmanship of Collectors/District Magistrates/Deputy Commissioners. The Act
further provides for the constitution of different Executive Committee at national and state levels.
Under its aegis, the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) for capacity building
and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) for response purpose have been set up. It also
mandates the concerned Ministries and Departments to draw up their own plans in accordance
with the National Plan. The Act further contains the provisions for financial mechanisms such as
creation of funds for response, National Disaster Mitigation Fund and similar funds at the state
and district levels for the purpose of disaster management. The Act also provides specific roles to
local bodies in disaster management.
2.7.3 Further the enactment of 73rd and 74th Amendments to the constitution and emergence of
local self- government, both rural and urban, as important tiers of governance, the role of local
authorities becomes very important. The DM Act, 2005 also envisages specific roles to be played
by the local bodies in disaster management.
2.7.4 Legal - Institutional Framework: A legal institutional framework developed based on the
provision of the Act across the country, in vertical and horizontal hierarchical and in the federal
setup of country may be seen in the Figure 2.2 for appreciation of response mechanism which
has been put in place.

the district to enforce the safety standards and also to arrange for relief measures and respond
to the disaster at the district level.

2.13. Institutional Framework for Metropolitan Cities
In the larger cities (say, with population exceeding 2.5 million), the recommendation of the second
Administrative Reforms Commission has suggested that the Mayor, assisted by the Commissioner
of the Municipal Corporation and the Police Commissioner to be directly responsible for Crisis
Management. It has now been accepted by the Government.

2.14 Hierarchical Structure of Authority and Committee
In this structure, National Disaster Management Authority is the authority for formulation of
policy and guidelines for all disaster management work in the country. The state authorities
further lay down the guidelines for departments of the state and the districts falling in their
respective jurisdictions. Similarly, district authorities direct the civil administration, departments
and local authorities such as the municipalities, police department and civil administration.
The State Executive Committees are responsible for execution of the tasks envisaged by the
authorities. The structure thus discussed is summarised in the Figure 2.3.

2.16. National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)
2.16.1 Constitution and role of NDRF: The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has
been constituted under Section 44 of the DM Act, 2005 by up-gradation/conversion of eight

62

Institutional Framework
standard battalions of Central Para Military Forces i.e. two battalions each from Border Security
Force (BSF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and
Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) to build them up as a specialist force to respond to disaster
or disaster like situations.
2.16.2 The eight battalions (1 battalion comprised of nearly 1000 person) of NDRF consist of
144 specialised teams trained in various types of natural, man made and non-natural disasters.
72 of such teams are designed to cater to the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear
(CBRN) calamities besides natural calamities. Each NDRF battalion consists of 1149 personnel
organised in 18 teams comprising of 45 personnel, who are being equipped and trained for
rendering effective response to any threatening disaster situation or disaster, both natural and
man made. All these eight battalions are being trained in natural disasters while four of them are
being additionally trained for handling CBRN disasters. The composition of such battalions may
be visited at www.ndmindia.nic.in
2.16.3 Based on vulnerability profile of different regions of the country, these specialist
battalions have been presently stationed at the following eight places as may be seen from
the map in Figure 2.6.

2.16.4 The Government of India has approved the raising of two additional battalions of National
Disaster Response Force by upgradation and conversion of one battalion each of Border
Security Force and Central Reserve Police Force to be located in the states of Bihar (Bihata,
Patna) and Andhra Pradesh (Vijaywada) respectively. The administrative approval for raising
the two battalions was issued on 13-10- 2010.
2.16.5 There are different training institutes where such forces are given the basic and
specialised training. The details of such training programmes are given in Chapter 7 of Capacity
Development.
2.17 State Disaster Response Force (SDRF)
The states/UTs have also been advised to set up their own Specialist Response Force for
responding to disasters on the lines of National Disaster Response Force vide Ministry of Home
Affairs letter dated 26th July 2007 and 8th March, 2011. The Central Government is providing
assistance for training of trainers. The state governments have been also advised to utilise 10
percent of their State Disaster Response Fund and Capacity Building Grant for the procurement
of search and rescue equipment and for training purposes of the Response Force.
2.18 Civil Defence
2.18.1 Aims and Objectives of Civil Defence Act: The Civil Defence Policy of the GoI until
1962 was confined to making the states and UTs conscious of the need of civil protection
measures and to keep in readiness civil protection plans for major cities and towns under the
Emergency Relief Organisation (ERO) scheme. The legislation on Civil Defence (CD) known as
Civil Defence Act was enacted in 1968 which is in force throughout the country.
2.18.2 The Act defines CD and provides for the powers of Central Government to make
rules for CD, spelling out various actions to be taken for CD measures. It further stipulates
for constitution of CD corps, appointment of members and officers, functions of members
etc. The Act has since been amended in 2010 to cater to the needs of disaster management

64

Institutional Framework
so as to utilise the services of Civil Defence volunteers effectively for enhancement of public
participation in disaster management related activities in the country.
2.18.3 The CD Organisation is raised only in such areas and zones which are considered
vulnerable to enemy attacks. The revision and renewal of categorised CD towns is done at
regular intervals, with the level of perceived threat or external aggression or hostile attacks by
anti- national elements or terrorists to vital installations.
2.18.4 Compendium of instructions – CD deals very briefly with all different aspects of CD in
India and includes references to important policy letters including legal aspects. It was first
published in February 1969. Subsequently, its scope was enlarged by including the Master
Plan of Civil Defence, Civil Defence Act 1968, training courses conducted at NCDC, Nagpur,
training syllabus of states.
2.18.5 Role of Civil Defence: During times of war and emergencies, the CD organisation has
the vital role of guarding the hinterland, supporting the armed forces, mobilising the citizens
and helping civil administration for saving life and property, minimising damage, maintaining
continuity in production centers and raising public morale. The concept of CD over the years
has shifted from management of damage against conventional weapons to also include threat
perceptions against nuclear weapons, biological and chemical warfare and environmental
disasters.
2.18.6 Three tier structure as given below has been created to formulate CD policy and for
coordinating and supervising measures to implement it.
• Civil Defence Advisory Committee under the Chairmanship of Union Home Minister,
• Civil Defence Committee under the Chairmanship of Home Secretary and
• Civil Defence Joint Planning Staff Committee under the Chairmanship of Director General
Civil Defence.
2.18.7 Eligibility to become volunteers:
(a) A person who intends to apply for appointment to a Civil Defence Corps must fulfill the
following conditions:• to be a citizen of India or Bhutan or of Nepal;
• to have completed the age of 18 years provided that this age limit may be relaxed at the
discretion of the competent authority up to a maximum of three years for any branch or
category of the Corps,
• to have passed at least the primary standard, that is to say, the fourth class; and this
condition may be relaxed by the Controller at his discretion.
(b) A person shall not be entitled to be appointed to the Corps unless he is found to be
physically fit and mentally alert.
(c) Any service in the National Volunteer Force and in the armed forces of the Union shall be
a special qualification

65

Disaster Management in India
(d) Such persons shall ordinarily serve in a voluntary and honorary capacity and they
are required to perform the duties assigned to them by order under the Civil Defence
Regulations, 1968 or under any other law for the time being in force, for the protection of
persons and property against hostile attack
(e) A candidate who has been accepted for appointment to the Corps shall be formally
enrolled in such manner as the Controller may, by order, determine and at the time of
enrollment shall make an oath or affirmation before such officer as the Controller may, by
order, appoint.
2.18.8 Directorate General of Civil Defence (DGCD): DGCD was established in 1962 with its
headquarters at New Delhi in the Ministry of Home Affairs to handle all policy and planning
matters related to Civil Defence, Home Guards and Fire Services including the functioning of
National Civil Defence College, and National Fire Service College, Nagpur. An IPS officer in the
rank of Director General of Police heads the organisation. He has dual charge of D.G. National
Disaster Response Force and Civil Defence (DG, NDRF & CD).
2.18.9 Civil Defence Setup in the States: The state government for the purpose of coordinating
the activities of the Controllers of Civil Defence within the state appoints a Director of Civil
Defence and also may constitute, for any area within the state a body of a person to be called
the Civil Defence Corps. Out of 225 towns from 35 states notified as CD towns, currently the CD
organisations at only 130 towns have been activated. Each town has nucleus of four Permanent
Staff along with 400 CD Volunteers for a two lakh population. It is expected that each state will
have one CD Training Institute with permanent strength of 36 personnel, five vehicles and
other equipments. The District Magistrate is designated as a Controller for CD Towns. The
present strength of CD volunteers is 5.72 lakhs, out of which 5.11 lakhs are already trained.
The target strength of CD volunteers has been fixed at 13 lakhs based on the population of CD
towns as per 2001 census.
In accordance with the directions issued by Hon’ble Home Minister, one member high
powered committee was constituted on 7th February, 2006 under the chairmanship of one
of the member of NDMA to analyse the existing functions of Civil Defence Organisations and
suggest changes required to enlarge its role to include Disaster Management.
2.18.10 Civil Defence at district level: The state government may appoint a person, not
being in its opinion, below the rank of a District Magistrate to be known as the “Controller”.
Under certain conditions, the state government may also appoint a Deputy Controller of Civil
Defence in appropriate rank up to that of Deputy Collector, but not inferior to that of a SubDivisional Magistrate.
2.19 Fire Services
2.19.1 Fire services are mandate of the Municipal Bodies as estimated in item 7 of Schedule
12 under Article 243W of the constitution. The structure across is not uniform. Presently Fire
prevention and Fire Fighting Services are organized by the concerned States and UTs. Ministry of
Home Affairs, Govt. of India, renders technical advice to the States and UTs and Central Ministries
on Fire Protection, Fire Prevention and Fire Legislation.
2.19.2 The Government of India in 1956, formed a “Standing Fire Advisory Committee” under the
Ministry of Home Affairs. The mandate of the committee was to examine the technical problems

66

Institutional Framework
relating to Fire Services and to advise the Government of India for speedy development and
upgradation of Fire Services all over the country. This committee had representation from each
State Fire Services, as well as the representation from Ministry of Home, Defence, Transport,
Communication and Bureau of Indian Standards. This Committee was renamed as “Standing
Fire Advisory Council” (SFAC) during the year 1980.
2.19.3 Fire Services in Gujarat, Chhatisgarh, Punjab, Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana
and Madhya Pradesh excluding Indore are under the respective concerned Municipal
Corporations. In other remaining States it is under the Home Department. While some States
have enacted their own Fire Act, some others have not. As on today, there is no standardization
with regard to the scaling of equipment, the type of equipment, or the training of their
manpower. In each state it has grown according to the initiatives taken by the States and the
funds provided for the Fire Services.
2.19.4 Presently the only Basic Life Line of Fire & Emergency Services which is fully committed
to the common public, is the Municipal in some states and State Fire Services. The Airport
Authority, Big Industrial Establishments, CISF and Armed Forces, however also have their own
Fire Services and many a times in case of need rush in aid to the local Fire Services. Apart
from the lack of being a proper government department with a complete developmental
plan, State Fire Services have their own organizational structure, administrative setup, funding
mechanism, training facilities and equipments.
2.20 National Civil Defence College (NCDC), Nagpur
The first Disaster Management Training Institution of the country was founded on 29th April 1957
at Nagpur as the Central Emergency Relief Training Institute (CERTI) to support the Emergency
Relief Organisation of the Government of India. This Institute organised advanced and specialist
training for revenue officials responsible for Disaster Relief Operations against any natural or
manmade disaster. CERTI was renamed as National Civil Defence College on 1st April 1968.
NCDC is mandated for conducting training courses for various groups of stakeholders. Details of
training on capacity development are given in Chapter on Capacity Development
2.21 National Fire Service College (NFSC), Nagpur
2.21.1 The National Fire Service College was established in 1956 as a sub- ordinate establishment
of Ministry of Home Affairs with the aim of providing training to the Fire Officers of the country
in advanced techniques of fire fighting and rescue, and creating uniformity in the Fire Service
organisations and their management across the country. NFSC began its activities with only
one course; later, considering the needs of the country, industrialisation and growth of Indian
industry, had added many more courses to its curriculum to give the fire training a professional
outlook.
2.21.2 The college has so far trained 15197 fire officers in the country. Being a residential
college, National Fire Service College (NFSC), has its own hostel facilities with well furnished
accommodation for about 200 trainees at a time.
2.21.3 The college awards certificates, diplomas, and advanced diplomas on successful
completion of courses. These are recognized by the state, central government, the public and

67

Disaster Management in India
private sectors and the business community as well. In addition, the diploma and advanced
diploma of NFSC are also recognised by the Union Public Service Commission for appointment
in the middle management cadre.
2.22 Home Guard
2.22.1 Role: The role of Home Guards is to serve as an auxiliary to the police in the maintenance
of law and order, internal security and help the community in any kind of emergency such as
air-raid, fire, cyclone, earthquake, epidemic etc. They are also expected to help the police in
maintenance of communal harmony, assist the administration in protecting weaker sections,
participate in socio-economic and welfare activities and perform Civil Defence duties.
2.22.2 Types: Home Guards are of two types – rural and urban besides in Border States, Border
Wing Home Guards Battalions at national level. Border Wing, Home Guard serve as an auxiliary
to the Border Security Force. The total strength of Home Guards is 5, 73,793 against which the
raised strength is 5,00,410. The organisation is spread over all states and UTs except in Kerala.
Eighteen Border Wing Home Guards (BWHG) Battalions have been raised in the border states
viz. Punjab (6 Bns.), Rajasthan (4 Bns.), Gujarat (4Bns.) and one of Bn each. for Assam, Meghalaya,
Tripura and West Bengal to serve as an auxiliary to Border Security Force for preventing
infiltration on the international border and coastal areas, guarding of vital Installations and
lines of communication in vulnerable areas at the time of external aggression.
2.22.3 Statutory Mechanisms and Service Condition: Home Guards are raised under the
Home Guards Act and Rules of the states and UTs. They are recruited from a cross section
of the population such as doctors, engineers, lawyers, private sector organisations, college
and university students, agricultural and industrial workers, etc. who give their spare time to
the organisation for betterment of the community. Home Guards are provided free uniform,
duty allowances and awards for gallantry, distinguished and meritorious services. Members
of Home Guards with three year service in the organisation are trained to assist police in
maintenance of law and order, prevention of crime, anti-decoity measures, border patrolling,
prohibition, flood relief, fire-fighting, election duties and social welfare activities.
The Ministry of Home Affairs formulates the policy regarding role, target, raising, training,
equipping, establishment and other important matters of Home Guards Organisation.
2.23 Interface between the Ministries for disaster Management
2.23.1 The interface between stakeholders and the disaster management framework is
permanent, backed by legislative measures, decisions, such as those taken for establishment
of the bodies and committees for managing disasters and the government orders to execute
these decisions. These decisions or measures direct the composition of the structure by
identifying the stakeholders to be involved in the disaster management framework. The role
to be performed by each stakeholder is in the evolving stage and needs to be defined within
different SOPs. Thus, while the involvement of stakeholders in the interface is mandated and
permanent, the nature of interface is guided by the expertise or relevance of the stakeholder
to the disaster management framework.
2.23.2 The expertise based interfaces emerge when the stakeholders serve as ‘service providers’
to the disaster management framework. For instance, the institutions under Ministry of Earth

68

Institutional Framework
Sciences and Ministry of Water Resources, that is, Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and
Central Water Commission (CWC) respectively, provide information on the weather and climatic
parameters and the potential hazards and threats to the nodal management authority. Further,
these organizations are involved with disaster planning activities – flood zonation and flood plain
management in case of CWC, and hazard mapping and database generation in case of IMD. The
organizations and institutions under the Department of Space provide research and technical
support by monitoring the weather elements and facilitating satellite based communication,
and also undertaking activities such as land use mapping and hazard zoning.
2.23.3 The framework which emerges from above discussion may be summarised in a flow
chart form as given in Figure 2.8.

2.23.3 The Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) should be seen as on integral part of environment
(climate change also) and development. The impending risk analysis should be done in the light
of disasters and possible threat of high intensity disasters due to climate change. Accordingly,
mitigation and adaptation programmes should be developed. The mitigation plan should address
the issues of structural and non-structural interventions along with the fiscal and monetary tools
(for DRR & adaptation) for pre and post disaster planning. If this is main streamed, sustainable
development can be attained and miseries of the people could be minimised. The top down
and bottom up institutional linkages for policy formulation and programme execution would be
interdependent with each other.

Policy and
Guidelines

3.1 Introduction
3.1.1 The National Authority, under the Disaster Management Act, has been mandated with
the responsibility for laying down the policies, plans and guidelines for disaster management
to ensure timely and effective response to disasters. It is further required to approve the plans
prepared by the ministries or departments of the Government of India in accordance with the
national plans. The guidelines laid down by the National Authority have to be followed by State
Authorities in drawing up their State Plans and the same is applicable to different ministries
and departments of the Government of India for the purpose of integrating the measures for
prevention of disaster or the mitigation of its effects in their development plans and projects.
The National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) has to follow the broad policies and
guidelines set by the NDMA.
3.1.2 The National Executive Committee, under the Act has to prepare the National Plan,
coordinate and monitor the implementation of the National Policy.
3.1.3 Similarly, the State Authority of each state has been given the responsibility for laying down
policies and plans for disaster management for their state, under the Act.

3.2 National Policy on Disaster Management (NPDM)
3.2.1 The National Policy on Disaster Management (NPDM) has been approved by the central
government on October 22, 2009 and circulated to all concerned. The policy envisages a safe and
disaster resilient India by developing a holistic, proactive, multi-disaster oriented and technology
driven strategy through a culture of prevention, mitigation, preparedness and response. The
policy covers all aspects of disaster management including institutional and legal arrangements,
financial arrangements, disaster prevention, mitigation and preparedness, techno-legal
regime, response, relief and rehabilitation, reconstruction and recovery, capacity development,
knowledge management, research and development. It focuses on the areas where action is
needed and the institutional mechanism through which such action can be channelised.
3.2.2 The NPDM addresses the concerns of all the sections of the society including differently
abled persons, women, children and other disadvantaged groups in terms of granting relief
and formulating measures for rehabilitation of the persons affected by disasters. The issue of
equity and inclusiveness has been accorded due consideration. It aims to bring in transparency
and accountability in all aspects of disaster management through involvement of community,
community based organisations, Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), local bodies and civil society.

3.3 National Plan on Disaster Management
3.3.1 An institutional mechanism for preparation of the National Plan has been put in place,
which is under preparation in three parts namely:(i) National Response Plan,
(ii) National Mitigation Plan and
(iii) National Capacity Building Plan.
3.3.2 A Facilitation Committee under the Chairmanship of Secretary (Border Management)
in the Ministry of Home Affairs and three sub-committees namely: (i) National Response
Plan Committee (ii) National Mitigation Plan Committee and (iii) National Capacity Building

71

Disaster Management in India
Plan Committee have been constituted for preparation of the National Plan on Disaster
Management.
3.3.3 The National Mitigation Plans are under preparation by the concerned nodal ministries for
disasters in respect of which the Nodal Ministries have been identified and designated (Table
3.1). The Nodal Officers of the ministries concerned with the disasters are the conveners of
the National Mitigation Plan Committees and are required to complete the Mitigation Plan in
consultation with the members concerned with the respective disasters in NDMA.

3.4 Focus and Objectives of Guidelines
NDMA is engaged in the formulation of guidelines through a consultative process involving
multiple stakeholders, including the government, non-government organisations, academic
and scientific institutions, the corporate sector and community. Since its inception, NDMA has
so far released various disaster specific and thematic guidelines. These may be visited at the site
www.ndma.gov.in. Salient features of the guidelines issued are as follows:3.4.1 Management of Landslide and Snow Avalanches: The objectives of these guidelines are
to institutionalise the landslide hazard mitigation efforts, to make the society aware of the various
aspects of landslide hazard in the country and to prepare the society to take suitable action to
reduce both risks and costs associated with this hazard. The guidelines include regulatory and
non-regulatory frameworks with defined time schedules for all activities.
3.4.2 Management of Cyclones: The guidelines aim to deal with the tropical cyclones by way
of appropriate coping strategies and risk reduction plans along with greater public awareness.
The guidelines call for proactive, participatory, fail safe, multi-disciplinary and multi-sector
approach at various levels. An approach encompassing Early Warning System on cyclones,
structural measures for preparedness and mitigation, covering cyclone shelters, buildings, road
links, drains, embankments, communication/power transmission networks, and non-structural
mitigation options, such as coastal zone management, coastal flood plain management, natural
resources management, awareness generation related to CDM, hazard zoning and mapping,
including the use of GIS tools, capacity development, etc; and its implementation strategies are
suggested.
3.4.3 Management of Earthquake: The guidelines emphasise that all new structures are built
in compliance with earthquake resistant building codes. Town planning, bye-laws, structural
safety audits of existing lifeline structures and other critical structures in earthquake prone areas,
carrying out selective seismic strengthening and retrofitting ought to be addressed.
3.4.4 Management of Floods: The guidelines aim at measures for preparedness, prevention,
mitigation in the pre-flood stage and on prompt and effective response, relief and recovery during

73

Disaster Management in India
– and post flood stages. Importance on non-structural measures besides structural measures is
emphasized in the guidelines. Setting of basin-wise organisations for flood management and
also for setting up a National Flood Management Institute for training, education and research
are suggested in the guideline.
3.4.5 Chemical Disasters (Industrial): These guidelines call for a protective, participatory,
well-structured, fail-safe, multi-disciplinary and multi-structural approach at various levels. On
the basis of vulnerabilities and consequences of chemical accidents, the guidelines review the
existing regulatory framework and practices and thus propose for a regulatory framework,
code of practices, capacity development, institutional framework, etc. They further set out an
approach for implementation of the guidelines.
3.4.6 Management of Chemical (Terrorism) Disasters: The guidelines focus on outlining
the preparedness and efforts made for mitigating the chemical terrorism, the act of violence
perpetrated to achieve professed aims, using chemical agents. While reviewing the existing
legislations and regulatory framework, the guidelines identify the gaps and propose the measures
required to fill the gaps in the legislative and regulatory frameworks. They also deal with the
aspects of surveillance measures for strengthening the intelligence in order to prevent intentional
use of chemical agents.
3.4.7 Preparation of State Disaster Management Plans: The aim of the state DM plan is
to ensure that the components of DM are addressed to facilitate planning, preparedness,
operational, coordination and community participation. The guideline suggests outlays for
preparation of the plan to include the state profile, vulnerability assessment and risk analysis,
prevention measures, mainstreaming DM concerns into developmental plan and programme
projects, preparedness measures, response and partnership with the other stakeholders besides
providing for financial arrangement.
3.4.8 Psycho-Social Support and Mental Health Services in Disasters: Disasters leave a trail
of agony and affect the survivors’ mental health. The guidelines on this subject outlay the entire
gamut of psycho-social support and mental health services with a view to build the nation
resilient to respond effectively in all types of disasters. The intent of these guidelines is to develop
and integrate a holistic, coordinated and pro-active strategy for management of psycho-social
support and mental health services after a disaster through a culture of prevention, mitigation
and preparedness to generate a prompt and effective response.
3.4.9 Medical Preparedness and Mass Casualty Management: A Mass Casualty Event (MCE)
is an incident resulting in a number of victims large enough to disrupt the normal course of
emergency and health care services. The guidelines for MCE focus on all aspects of medical
preparedness and mass casualty management with emphasis on prevention, mitigation
preparedness, relief and medical response etc. They aim to develop a rigorous medical
management framework to reduce the number of deaths during MCE.
3.4.10 Management of Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies: The overall objective of the
guidelines is to implement the concept of prevention of nuclear and radiological emergencies.
. In rare cases of their occurrence due to factors beyond human control, the guidelines suggest
the emergency should be managed through certain pre-planned and established structural and
non-structural measures to minimise risks to health, life and the environment.

74

Policy and Guidelines
3.4.11 Incident Response System: These guidelines provide directions and guidelines
to central ministries and the states for an effective and well coordinated response.
They suggest a multi-disciplinary, and systematic approach to guide administrative
mechanisms at all levels of the government with scope for participation of private sector,
NGOs, PRIs and communities to work together seamlessly in the response activities. The
guidelines are applicable to the management of all incidents - natural or human-made.
The proposed methodology is expected to be equally useful for handling all kinds of
incidents such as terrorism (Counter Insurgency), law and order situations, serial bomb
blast, hijacking, air accidents, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) disasters,
mine disaster, port and harbour emergencies, forest fires, oil field fires and oil spills.
3.4.12 Strengthening of Safety and Security for Transportation of POL tankers: The
guidelines envisage measures for prevention and for adoption of preparedness practices to
a level that there is no chance of error. This calls for firming up the regulations, setting up of
mechanisms of strict conformation, as well as fail proof functioning by each role player.
3.4.13 Management of Biological Disaster: The guidelines for management of biological
disasters focus on all aspects of Biological Disaster Management (BDM) including Bio-terrorism
(BT). It emphasises a preventive approach such as immunisation of first responders and stockpiles
of medical countermeasures based upon risk reduction measures by developing a rigorous
medical management framework to reduce the number of deaths during biological disasters,
both intentional and accidental. These include the development of specialised measures
pertaining to the management of biological disasters.
3.4.14 Management of Tsunami :The guidelines present an introductory overview on the
tsunami risk and vulnerability in the country and the preparedness as a nation. It provides for
structural mitigation measures and lay down strategies for protecting lifeline with the sea front
besides laying down the guidance for developing the techno legal regime and giving an account
of various tool kits for tsunami risk management.
3.4.15 Role of NGOs in Disaster Management: The guidelines discuss the role of NGOs in
disaster preparedness, mitigation and response and spell out the institutional mechanism for
improving the effectiveness of disaster management through effective coordination between
NGOs and the government at different levels.
3.4.16 Urban Flooding: The guidelines aim to develop plans for the management of urban
flooding with a view to guide the ministry and other government bodies for preparation of their
disaster management plans on this aspect of disaster, recurrent in urban areas during monsoon.
While reviewing the existing international and national practices for the design and maintenance
of the urban drainage system, it addresses the issue of urban flood risk, vulnerability analysis and
hazard mapping and provides for response action.
3.4.17 Management of Dead in the Aftermath of Disaster: These guidelines are aimed at
institutionalising the standard procedure for proper management of dead bodies and animal
carcasses in the aftermath of disasters.
3.4.18 Plan to counter threats to Municipal Water Supply and Water Reservoirs : The plan
aims to counter any threat to municipal water supply and water reservoir in view of such a

75

Disaster Management in India
perception and taking into account the present water supply system and legislative framework.
The plan suggests to framing a preparedness plan and also outlining the guidelines for a standard
operating plan.
3.4.19 NDMA from time to time has also been organizing workshops on different issues related
to disasters and publishing its reports for action by concerned Ministry or agency. Such reports
are given as under
(i) Training regime for disaster response: The key to efficiency in disaster response does
not lie in good equipment but in effective ongoing training of NDRF personnel. . The
report on the training regime is the outcome of detailed needs analysis, followed by
extensive research on good practices in disaster response training in vogue within the
country and elsewhere in the world. The training regime so devised aims to help the
process of capacity building of NDRF for efficient and effective discharge of its onerous
responsibility.
(ii) Pandemic Preparedness: The outcome of the workshop held on the subject on 2122nd April, 2008 deals with the existing status of preparedness at different levels of the
government and attached offices and inter-dependency of the sectors. The report presents
the recommendations following two days of deliberations, on the subject.
(iii) Revamping of Civil Defence set up in the country: The changing scenario, reducing
changes and occurrence of traditional wars, an steadily and increasing threat from natural
and man- made disasters, with large scale devastation of life and property, warrants a greater
role on the part of Civil Defence from merely hostile act-centric responsibility to a holistic
role in all the facets of disaster management in the country. It recommends revamping the
existing structure of civil defence for enhancing its functional responsibilities in realistic and
cost effective manner.

3.5 Management of Droughts26
3.5.1 The new manual for drought management is jointly prepared by MOA & NIDM and issued
in November 2009. It suggests a system for drought management policy and programmes to
be followed by the Government of India and state governments. It focuses on the general and
common elements of drought management at the national level, while allowing the states to
include their specific schemes and interventions. The manual incorporates drought forecasting,
monitoring, response and mitigation as a continuum of activities.
3.5.2 The manual is divided into following sections, namely - understanding drought, its
monitoring, declaration of drought, providing relief and measures taken for mitigation of
drought. While classifying the droughts of different types and associated vulnerability, the
guidelines suggests the measures for management of drought. The guidelines lay emphasis
on risk management rather than following the traditional approach of crisis management as a
reactive response measure. The vital components of drought management namely, drought
intensity assessment, it’s declaration, prioritisation of areas of drought management and
implementation of drought management strategy are outlined in the guidelines. The manual
may also be visited on NDMA’s website at the link : http://ndma.gov.in/ndma/guidelines/

Policy and Guidelines

3.8 Conclusion
The policy and guidelines are only illustrative. The concerned Ministries related to DM activities,
either have come out with their own policy, plans and regulatory mechanisms for management
of disasters pertaining to their domain or are at different stages of its formulations. It is hoped
that by going through the details of the available policy and the guidelines and other information
at one place, the other ministries, states and the stakeholders may get necessary inputs and
guidance to use them and come up with effective and implementable plans at their level.

Prevention
and Mitigation

4.1 Introduction
The Yokohama message emanating from the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction
in May 1994 underlined the need for an emphatic shift in the strategy for disaster mitigation.
It inter-alia stressed that disaster prevention, mitigation, preparedness and relief were four
elements, which contribute to and gain from the implementation of the sustainable development
policies. These elements along with environmental protection and sustainable development,
are closely inter related. Nations, therefore should incorporate them in their development plans
and ensure efficient follow up measures at the community, sub-regional, regional, national and
international levels. Disaster prevention, mitigation and preparedness are better than disaster
response in achieving the goals and objectives of vulnerability reduction.
It would be evident from the table given in 4.1 that if we compare the disasters of similar
magnitude in USA and Japan with that of India it is found that the loss of lives in USA and Japan
are much less as compared to that of India. The factors influencing reduced loss is attributed to
the better preparedness in USA and Japan.

4.2 Mainstreaming of Disaster Risk Reduction in Developmental Strategy
4.2.1 Prevention and mitigation contribute to lasting improvement in safety and should be
integrated in the disaster management. The Government of India has adopted mitigation and
prevention as essential components of their development strategy. Accordingly, the Tenth Five
Year Plan document has a detailed chapter on disaster management. The plan emphasises
the fact that development cannot be sustainable without mitigation being built into the
developmental process.

81

Disaster Management in India
4.2.2 Mainstreaming DRR involves incorporating disaster risk reduction into development
policy and practice. It means radically expanding and enhancing disaster risk reduction so that
it becomes normal practice, fully institutionalised within an agency’s relief and development
agenda. Mainstreaming has three purposes:
(a) To make certain that all the development programmes and projects that originate from or
are funded by an agency, are designed with evident consideration for potential disaster risks
and to resist hazard impact,
(b) To make certain that all the development programmes and projects that originate from or
are funded by an agency, do not inadvertently increase vulnerability to disaster in all sectors:
social, physical, economic and environment,
(c) To make certain that all the disaster relief and rehabilitation programmes and projects that
originate from or are funded by an agency are designed to contribute to developmental
aims and to reduce future disaster risk.
4.2.3 Mainstreaming DRR into the developmental plans is an important mandate of the Disaster
Management Act 2005. Integration of disaster risk reduction measures into ongoing flagship
programmes of Government of India is being used as an entry point for mainstreaming DRR
in development plans. Steps for ensuring the incorporation of DRR into various ongoing
programmes\plans are as follows:
(a) Identification of key programme/projects of Government of India,
(b) Identification of entry points within the programme for integration of DRR (structural, nonstructural and other mitigation measures) at various levels viz. national, state and district
levels,
(c) Close coordination with concerned departments such as State Planning Commission and
Finance Department for promoting DRR measures into development plans and policies,
(d) Advocacy for allocation of dedicated budget for DRR within the departmental plans,
(e) Preparation of guidelines for integration of disaster risk reduction measures into development
plans of various departments at the district and sub-district levels.
4.2.4 Mainstreaming of National Plan and its Sub-Plan: Three committees constituted by
Government of India are working for preparing the National Response Plan, National Human
Resource and Capacity Development Plan and Mitigation Plans by respective ministries who have
been designated as nodal agencies for the disaster relating to their activities. The draft National
Response Plan and National Human Resource and Capacity Development Plan are ready. Certain
rectifications and modifications are underway before it is presented to the National Executive
Committee for its approval.
4.2.5 It is expected that National Response Plan will be put in place once it is adopted by
Government of India. It will pave the way for institutionalising the response plan at three tiers as
envisaged in the Disaster Management Act.
4.2.6 Similarly, the Capacity Development Plan, once approved and adopted will provide a
roadmap for undertaking the capacity building for people engaged in different facets of disaster
management and enhance the capacity at the individual, organizational as well as at the
environmental levels.

82

Prevention and Mitigation
4.2.7 Mitigation Plans have been submitted by the ministries of Defence, Mines (Geological
survey of India), Department of Atomic Energy, Department of Agriculture & Cooperation,
Railways and Water Resources, which are under examination and finalization. It is expected that
once these mitigation plans are approved, the concerned ministry will undertake activities for
taking the prevention and mitigation measures to address the hazard and risk involved in the
activities of their sector. It would be the endeavor of the government to persuade the other
ministries who have yet to bring their Mitigation Plans at the draft stage to take it further for
approval and adoption.

4.3 National Disaster Mitigation Fund:
4.3.1 Section 47 of the Disaster Management Act 2005 provides for constitution of National
Disaster Mitigation Fund. The provisions of the Act are as under:
(a) The Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, constitute a fund to
be called the National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) for projects exclusively for the
purpose of mitigation and there shall be credited thereto such amount which the Central
Government may, after due appropriation made by parliament by law in this behalf.
(b) The National Disaster Mitigation Fund shall be applied by the National Disaster Management
Authority.
4.3.2 The modalities of constitution of NDMF have been discussed by MHA with the MoF,
Planning Commission and NDMA from time to time. A reference was made to 13th Finance
Commission. The 13th Finance Commission has given its report and as per its recommendations:
“Mitigation and reconstruction activities should be kept out of the schemes funded through
Finance Commission grants and met out of overall development plan funds of the centre and the
states.”The issue is under consideration of Ministry of Home Affairs with other concerned Ministries.

4.4. Measures taken for Prevention and Mitigation of Hazards
Risk of destruction and casualties associated with different disasters can substantially be reduced
by introduction of prevention and mitigation measures. Mitigation is generally categorised into
two main types of activities i.e. structural and non-structural. Structural mitigation refers to any
physical construction to reduce or avoid possible impacts of hazards, which include engineering
measures and construction of hazard-resistant protective structures and infrastructure. Nonstructural mitigation refers to policies, awareness, knowledge development, public commitment,
and methods and operating practices, including participatory mechanisms and the provision of
information, which can reduce risk with related impacts. The Government of India has adopted
several mitigation measures for reducing the risk of being affected by disasters. These measures
are being implemented by the concerned ministries. Some of these initiatives are described below.

4.5 Earthquakes
4.5.1 India has been divided into five seismic zones according to the maximum intensity of
earthquakes expected. Of these, zone V is most active and comprises whole of Northeast India,
the northern portion of Bihar, western Uttar Pradesh hills, Himachal Pradesh and Andaman &
Nicobar Islands.
4.5.2 Pace of Urbanisation in India has been increasing. Many of the cities and townships including
the national capital of New Delhi, are located in zones of high seismic risk. Typically, the majority
of the constructions in these cities are not earthquake resistant. Regulatory mechanisms are

83

Disaster Management in India
weak, thus any earthquake striking in one of these cities would turn into a major disaster. Six
major earthquakes have struck different parts of India over a span of last 15 years. The following
measures have been initiated for prevention and mitigation of such disasters:
4.5.3 National Earthquake Risk Mitigation Project (NERMP): Understanding the importance
of the management of such hazardous situations caused by the earthquake, the Government
of India has taken a national initiative for launching a project of ‘National Earthquake Risk
Mitigation Project (NERMP). The proposed project aims at strengthening the structural and nonstructural earthquake mitigation efforts and reducing the vulnerability in the high risk districts
prone to earthquakes. Necessary risk mitigation measures are proposed to be put in place in
the highly seismic zones. NDMA, tasked with this project has prepared a Detailed Project Report
(DPR) which is under consultation with all the stakeholders. The proposed components of the
project include techno-legal regime, institutional strengthening, capacity building and public
awareness etc.
4.5.4 National Building Code (NBC): The National Building Code of India (NBC), a comprehensive
building code, is a national instrument providing guidelines for regulating the building
construction activities across the country. The NBC was first published in 1970 at the instance
of Planning Commission and was revised in 1983. Thereafter three major amendments, two in
1987 and the third in 1997 were issued. Considering a series of further developments in the
field of building construction, including the lessons learnt in the aftermath of number of natural
calamities like devastating earthquakes and super cyclones, a project for comprehensive revision
of NBC was taken up under the aegis of National Building Code Committee. The revised NBC has
now been brought out as National Building Code of India 2005 (NBC 2005). The salient features
of the revised NBC include meeting the challenges posed by natural calamities and reflecting the
state-of-the-art and contemporary applicable international practices. The code may be accessed
at http://www.bis.org.in/sf/nbc.htm.
Box 4.1: Building collapse in Lalita Park, Laxmi Nagar, Delhi
There was an incidence of building collapse in Lalita Park, Laxmi Nagar, East Delhi on 15th November 2010.
Several people lost their life and many injured in this incidence. Lt. Governor of National Capital Delhi
appointed an inquiry commission by exercising of the power conferred by section 3 of the Commission
of Inquiry Act, 1952 (60 of 1952) and read with the Notification No. F.2/4/66-UT dated 20th August, 1966,
issued by Govt. of India, Ministry of Home Affairs.
Single member, namely, Sh. Lokeshwar Prasad, retired Justice of Delhi High Court has been appointed.
The terms of reference of the Commission is as under:1.

to determine the immediate and proximate causes for the collapse of the building,

2.

to determine the circumstances and sequences of events leading to the collapse of the building,

3.

to fix responsibility, both individual and institutional, for the collapse of this building and for the
building already built that are unsafe structurally in East Delhi,

4.

to determine the administrative, procedural and statutory lapses of various departments and
agencies to evaluate structural safety aspects of buildings already built or proposed to be built in
East Delhi and to recommend remedial measures,

5.

to recommend measures that will combat corruption and make concerted public servant
accountable for construction of unsafe building.

It is expected the commission will come out with recommendations, which may be useful for
framing policy and action to contain such mishaps in future.

Jammu & Kashmir Earthquake 2005- Retrofitting on walls and windows

4.5.5 Effective implementation of these codes has been a challenge. The Bureau of Indian
Standards & National Design and Research Forum with the Institute of Engineers have organised
series of brainstorming sessions and workshops to pave the way to inculcate the same into
practice. As part of their continuous efforts, a workshop has been scheduled in the month of in
May 2011 titled “Implementation of Standards in Infrastructural Development”.
4.5.6 Efforts by Building Materials & Technology Promotion Council (BMTPC): The BMTPC
undertook projects for retrofitting of life-line structures for generating awareness among the
people as well as various government agencies about the need and techniques of retrofitting.
The Council has initiated retrofitting of MCD school buildings in Delhi. It has further initiated
a study of 250 bedded hall of Bara Hindu Rao Hospital, New Delhi. It has earlier carried out
seismic strengthening and retrofitting of the sub-district hospital in Kupwara in Jammu &
Kashmir, 442 structures in Gujarat and primary school buildings at Thano, Block Raipur and
Dehradun. The experience on these retrofitted buildings is aimed to help people at large
and the policy makers in particular in working towards reducing the vulnerability of lakhs of
existing public and private buildings, thereby protecting most number of people in case of
future earthquakes.
4.5.7 Earthquake and Seismic Zones: The entire Indian landmass, susceptible to different levels of
earthquake hazards, referred to as Zone II to V as per the Seismic Zoning Map of India contained
in IS 1893:2002 Fifth Revision.

85

Disaster Management in India

Multi-purpose Cyclone Shelter, Kendrapada, Orissa

The general basis of the zones is as follows:
Zone V: Covers the areas liable to seismic intensity 1X and above on MSK (1964) Intensity scale.
This is the most severe seismic zone and is referred here as Very High Damage Risk Zone.
Zone IV: Gives the area liable to MSK VIII. This zone is second in severity to zone V. This referred
here as High Damage Risk Zone.
Zone III: The associated intensity is MSK VII. This is termed here as moderate Damage Risk Zone.
Zone II: The probable intensity is MKS VII. This zone is referred to as Low Damage Risk Zone.
Note: In the revision of the Seismic Zone Map given earlier in the Vulnerability Atlas of India 1997, the seismic zone I has now
been merged into Seismic Zone II and renamed as Zone II, Zone III has been extended to cover more areas in Maharashtra,
Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Zones IV and V have remained unchanged.

It may be mentioned here that the new intensity scale, called as MSK Intensity Scale 1964, is
much more detailed and quantitative in nature as compared to the Modified Mercalli (MM)
though almost similar in intensity. Hence MSK has been used in place of MM in the classification
of the seismic zones given above
4.5.8 Initiative by Ministry of Panchayati Raj: It releases funds under Backward Regions Grant
Fund (BRGF) for meeting critical infrastructural gaps and other developmental requirements.
The ministry has financed several district plans under the BRGF for construction of panchayat
buildings, anganwadi centres, school buildings, class rooms, roads, bridges, culverts etc. and
restructuring of State Institutes for Rural Development (SIRD) buildings, block resource centres,
panchayat training centers etc. The ministry, vide its letter No. N-11012/35/2007- P&J, dated 2nd
February 2010 has advised all the states that it is imperative for all such structures to be made
disaster resilient in the line with the national vision of disaster management.

Prevention and Mitigation

4.6 Cyclones
4.6.1 National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (NCRMP) Initiative: Recurrent cyclones account for
a large number of deaths, loss of livelihood opportunities, loss of public and private property,
and severe damage to infrastructure, thus reversing the developmental gains whenever disasters
occur. In order to reduce the loss of life and properties in the events of future calamities, the
NCRMP has been launched by MHA in three phases in the cyclone prone coastal states and Union
Territories, keeping in view the vulnerability of the states and their readiness with investment
proposals.
Box 4.2: National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project
Aim: The scheme aims to upgrade cyclone forecasting, tracking and warning systems, build capacity in
multi-hazard risk management and to construct major infrastructures including multi-purpose cyclone
shelters and embankments.
Outcome: The project is expected to benefit 5.60 lac people in Orissa and over 5.50 lacs in Andhra
Pradesh.
Execution Authority: The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has been designated as
the implementing agency. The scheme is regularly monitored by NDMA and MHA.
Principal Components: The major components under the scheme are as follows;
• Community mobilisation and training,
• Cyclone Risk Mitigation Infrastructure (construction of cyclone shelters, roads/missing links and
construction/repair of Saline Embankments etc.),
• Technical assistance for capacity building on Disaster Risk Management (risk assessment, damage
and need assessment),
• Capacity Building and knowledge creation along with project management and implementation
support.
States covered: In the first phase of the project, states of Orissa and Andhra Pradesh are being covered.
Project cost: The total outlay of the project is `1496.71 crore. The World Bank is providing financial
assistance equivalent to `1198.44 crore and contribution from the state governments is `298.27 crore (
i.e. Orissa- ` 132.98 crore and Andhra Pradesh – `165.29 crore).

4.6.2 Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project (ICZMP): The Government of India
under the aegis of Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) has launched the ICZMP. The
objective of the project is to assist GoI in building the national capacity for implementation of
a comprehensive coastal management approach in the country and piloting the integrated
coastal zone management approach in states of Gujarat, Orissa and West Bengal.
Box 4.3: Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project
There are four components of this project:
(i)

Capacity Building: It includes mapping, delineation and demarcation of the hazard lines, and
delineation of coastal sediment cells all along the mainland coast of India.

(ii) Piloting ICZM approaches in Gujarat: This component will support capacity building of the state
level agencies and institutions, including preparation of an ICZM plan for the coastal sediment cell
that includes the Gulf of Kachchh and pilot investments.

87

Disaster Management in India

(iii) Piloting ICZM approaches in Orissa: It provides for capacity building of the state level agencies
and institutions, including preparation of an ICZM plan for the coastal sediment cells that include
the stretches of Paradip-Dhamra and Gopalpur-Chilika, including a regional coastal process study,
and pilot investments.
(iv) Piloting ICZM approaches in West Bengal: The project cost is ` 1425 crores ($285.67 million) and
it is slated to be completed by 31 Dec. 2015.

4.7 Floods
4.7.1 National Flood Risk Mitigation Project (NFRMP): NFRMP has been envisaged for
mitigation or reduction in risk, severity or consequences of floods. It aims at ensuring that
arrangements are in place to mobilise the resources and capability for relief, rehabilitation,
reconstruction and recovery from disasters besides creating awareness among vulnerable
communities. NDMA has been entrusted to prepare a Detailed Project Report (DPR) on Flood
Risk Mitigation Project.
4.7.2 Flood Management Programme: The state governments are engaged in flood
management work since the independence of the country. Upto the Tenth Five Year Plan, 45.6
million hectares (m-ha.) of flood prone areas in the country had been provided a reasonable
degree of protection. The Eleventh Five Year Plan envisages protecting an additional area of
2.18 million hectares. Management of water resources is primarily the responsibility of the
state governments. The schemes for Flood Control and Protection are therefore, to be planned,
funded and executed by the state governments. The Government of India, under the aegis of
Ministry of Water Resources has launched the “Flood Management Programme (FMP)” at a total
cost of ` 8000 crores for the 11th Plan period (2007-12).

flood control, anti-erosion, drainage development, anti-sea erosion, and flood proofing works
besides flood prone area development programme in critical regions and restoration of damaged
flood control/ management works).

(ii) The spillover works of on-going central plan schemes of Xth Plan would also be supported under this
scheme during XI Plan.
Executing Authority: The FMP scheme has been implemented by Flood Control, Water Resources /
Irrigation Departments of the state governments.

Under the programme, a total of 311 flood management work schemes of critical nature are
included from 19 States for central assistance up to 31st March, 2010, out of which 117 works for
10 States are reported to be physically complete. It is expected that 1.33 billion hectares of flood
prone areas have thus been restored and protected which will provide safety to about 12.89
million people during high floods.

Disaster Management in India
4.7.3 For the year 2010-11, another 42 new flood management schemes have been included
under the FMP from Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, J&K, Kerala, Manipur, Orissa, Pondicherry, Tamil
Nadu, Uttarakhand, U.P. and West Bengal.

4.8 Study of Land Contour by GSI
4.8.1 Geological Survey of India (GSI) studied the shape and material of the land getting
inundated and generates data on area, shape, slope, infiltration and permeability of soil of
the basin, drainage pattern, landform and longitudinal and cross profiles of the channels. On
the basis of these studies, GSI produces flood hazard maps indicating prohibitive, Restricted,
Cautionary and Flood Free Zones.
4.8.2 Significant flood related studies and recommendations made by GSI are as follows
• Brahmaputra Valley - A comprehensive geo-environmental database for environmental
management and flood control generated,
• Lower Banas sub-basin- selective irrigation to prevent rise of ground water table recommended,
• Kandi basin West Bengal- GSI recommended construction of small weirs to reduce impact of
flood,
• Mokameh Tal area in the Ganga Flood Plain- rejuvenation of existing drainage channels to
reduce flood problem recommended,
• Lower Damodar Basin- diversion along artificial canals and re-excavation of old river channel
recommended,
• Landslide zonation map for Himalayan region,
• The contribution of snow melting to annual flood.
GSI’s flood related studies are used by Central Water Commission, Water Resource Development
Project Authorities, Urban and Rural Planning Authorities, Ministry of Environment and Forest
and Ministry of Agriculture etc.

4.9 Landslides
In view of challenges caused
by landslides, the ‘National
Landslide Risk Mitigation Project’
(NLRMP) has been proposed
to be launched. It aims at
strengthening the structural
and non-structural landslide
mitigation efforts, reducing the
landslide risk and vulnerability
in the hilly districts prone to
landslides and mud flows and
minimise the risks arising out of
disasters in landslides. NDMA
has been entrusted to prepare

4.10 Tsunami
4.10.1 The Tsunami of 26th December 2004 caused extensive damage to life and property in the
States of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and UTs of Puducherry and Andaman & Nicobar
Islands (A&NI). It hit the fishermen community badly besides their means of livelihood. There
had also been extensive damage to the infrastructure including houses, harbors, jetties, roads,
bridges, power, telecom, hospitals, schools and other social sector buildings after Tsunami in
Samanthanpettai village Nagapattanam.
Box 4.5: Measures by Japan
Japan, where tsunami science and response measures first began following disaster in 1896. The
country has built many tsunami walls of up to 4.5 meters (15ft) to protect the populated coastal areas.
Other localities have built floodgates and channels to redirect the water from incoming tsunami.
However, their effectiveness has been questioned, as tsunami often overtops the barriers. For
instance, the Okushiri Hokkaido tsunami which struck Okushiri Island of Hokkaido within two to five
minutes of the earthquake on July 12, 1993 created waves as high as 30 meters (100ft) tall - as high
as a 10-storey building. The port town on Aonae was completely protected by tsunami wall, but the
waves washed right over the wall and destroyed all the wood-framed structures in the area. The wall
may have succeeded in slowing down and moderating the height of tsunami, but it did not prevent
major destruction and loss of lives.

4.10.2 One of the natural measures which could be adopted for mitigating the impact of
tsunami is using shoreline tree cover. Tree plantation is a cost-effective long- lasting means
of tsunami mitigation in comparison to the artificial barriers. Some locations of Indian Ocean

where Tsunami struck in 2004 remained almost intact because the existing coconut palms
and mangroves trees absorbed the tsunami’s energy. Similarly, the village of Naluvedapathy in
Tamil Nadu region faced minimal damage and few deaths because of the forest of 80, 244 trees
planted along the shoreline in 2002

4.11 Droughts
4.11.1 The Department of Agriculture & Cooperation, under the Ministry of Agriculture,
Government of India released a manual for drought management in November, 2009. The
manual suggests for looking beyond the traditional drought management through famine
codes for dealing with situations of mass hunger and collective penury. It focuses on plans
which take into account all capabilities of the state to address the impact of drought i.e., focus
on mitigation measures, tapping newer technologies, enabling the systems adapt to the new
legal framework and including improvement and area development programmes in drought
mitigation.
4.11.2 The National Institute of Agriculture and Extension (MANAGE), Hyderabad has been
identified to launch a National Project for Integrated Drought Monitoring & Management, with
MANAGE as the lead partner. A proposal submitted by MANAGES to implement this national
project through available budgetary provisions of Department of Agriculture & Cooperation is
under consideration. Another proposal to set up a National Institute of Drought Management is
also under consideration of Ministry of Agriculture & Cooperation.
4.11.3 The Drought Prone Areas Programme (DPAP) and Desert Development Programme (DDP)
are being implemented by the Government of India since 1973-74 and 1977-78 respectively.
These programmes aim at drought proofing and minimising desertification of fragile areas in

92

Prevention and Mitigation
the arid, semi-arid and dry-sub humid regions often affected by severe drought conditions and
desertification.
4.11.4 National Rainfed Area Authority in the Ministry of Agriculture has been set up to address
the issue of drought mitigation on a long term basis. It comprises experts who provide knowledge
inputs regarding systematic upgradation and management of the country’s dryland and rainfed
agriculture.
4.11.5 The Ministry of Agriculture & Cooperation has also undertaken some other measures to
address the drought management including:
• Implementation of water harvesting conservation, artificial recharge of ground water,
traditional water harvesting and conservation, water saving technologies like drip and
sprinkler irrigation systems, improved water saving farm practices, long term irrigation
management etc,
• Working towards convergence of lessons learnt from studies carried out by multiple institutions
working in related fields such as Central Research Institute for Dry land Agriculture (CRIDA),
International Crop Research for Semi-arid Tropics (ICRISAT), India Meteorological Department
(IMD), National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) and Indian Council for Agricultural Research
(ICAR), etc,
• Exploring practices such as harvesting cereal crops for fodder, supplemental irrigation if
feasible, and ensuring availability of seeds when alternative crops are beneficial with logistic
support from state and district machineries,
• Maximising efficient use of available surface and groundwater in drought prone areas i.e. to
resort to drip and sprinkler practices wherever possible, particularly for commercial crops
including fruit orchards,
• Undertaking construction of water shed structures at the right place to enhance water
recharge for life saving irrigation at critical stages of crop growth and during drought
situations, and
• Using optimally the services of Village Resources Centre established by Indian Space Research
Organisation, ICAR, State Agriculture University and other organisations towards management
of drought.

4.12 Fire
4.12.1 A Centrally Sponsored Scheme for Strengthening of Fire and Emergency Service in the
country was launched in November 2009 at an outlay of ` 200 crores. The overall objective of the
scheme is to strengthen fire and emergency services in the country and progressively transform
it into Multi-Hazard Response Force capable of acting as first responder in all types of emergency
situations. As the scheme is to be implemented with the centre and state contributions for
procurement of equipment (in the ratio of 75:25 and for north-eastern states in the ratio of 90:10)
within the XIth Five Year Plan period, the state governments are to contribute ` 40.23 crore as
their share.

4.12.3 Fire Hazard and Risk Analysis of fire services in the Country: The MHA has proposed
to undertake a study on fire hazard and risk analysis of fire services in the country. The aim of the
study is to identify gaps in existing fire services and evolve strategies for mitigating impacts of
fire hazards in the country. The outcome of the study will be used to formulate an action plan
(state/UT wise) for augmentation and future development of the fire services along with the
plan to source the funding for its implementation. As a part of study, the consultant would be
required to organise visits to each of the fire stations and fire service organisations in the country
and generate database through primary and secondary surveys. Govt. of India has prepared the
list of Multi-Hazard districts. List of Multi-Hazard districts is shown in Table 4.4.

Disaster Management in India

4.13 Forest Fire Management:
4.13.1 Fire prevention, detection and suppression activities are state subjects. The Central
Government has been formulating policy, planning and financing the states from time to time.
Forest Protection Division of Ministry of Forests headed by DIG of Forests is responsible for the
forest fire management at the central level. The Joint Forest Management Committees, 36,165 in
number across the country, have been given the responsibility to protect the forests from fires.
The Central Government has issued the National Forest Fire, Prevention and Control guidelines
and has also worked on a National Master Plan on Forest Fire Control.
4.13.2 A centrally sponsored scheme ‘Intensification of Forest Management’ initiated since the
Tenth Five Year Plan has allocated 15 percent of the funds for forest fire management.

4.14 Oil Industry
In the oil industry, the disaster management plan is maintained at the area level and covers
a wide aspect (since their activities are likely to affect local people also). Oil companies have
established their Crisis Management Plan at the company level and at the HQ level also with
specialist to deal with fires and other identified hazards. In oil companies, it has been observed
that international players for rescue and recovery operations are also hired at very short notice
at cater to the specific requirements.

4.15 Chemical Disasters
The MOEF has taken the following measures towards developing a Regulatory Framework for
Chemical Safety:
(i) The Environment (Protection) Act was enacted in 1986. Under the Act, two rules have been
notified for ensuring chemical safety, namely,
(a) The Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals Rules, 1989 (MSIHC)
amended in 1994 and 2000;
(b) The Chemical Accidents (Emergency, Planning, Preparedness, and Response) Rules,
1996 (EPPR) under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.
(ii) The Public Liability Insurance Act 1991, amended in 1992 and the Public Liability Insurance
Rules 1991, amended in 1993 require maximum hazard units to procure an insurance policy
and deposit an equal amount in the Environment Relief Fund to provide immediate relief to
victims of chemical accidents.

4.16 Prevention of Disasters in Mines
The various safeguards and preventive measures against coal mine fires are outlined in the
Coal Mines Regulations, 1957 and related circulars, notifications and technical instructions.
The Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS) examines from each and every application
for underground and surface mining from all considerations. Wherever necessary the DGMS
imposes additional precautionary and preventive measures. The officers of the DGMS from
time to time inspect the mines to assess the implementation of the measures and suggest
modifications, etc.
For the new projects and reorganisational projects, after the issuance of the EIA Notification,
1994 under the Environment (protection) Act, 1986, it has become compulsory to get

96

Prevention and Mitigation
environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) and for this
the mines are required to develop their Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) in which
the problems of the mine fires are adequately addressed as the mine fires have considerable
environmental impacts.

4.17 Epidemics
4.17.1 The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare is instrumental and responsible for implementation
of various programmes on a national scale in the areas of prevention and control of major
communicable diseases and promotion of traditional and indigenous systems of medicines.
This ministry also assists states in preventing and controlling the spread of seasonal disease
outbreaks and epidemics through technical assistance. It is actively involved in disease diagnosis
during epidemics and outbreaks, operational research, manpower development, advisory role
and other multifarious activities towards prevention and control of a cascade of epidemic
prone disease of larger public health importance in collaboration with National Institute of
Communicable Disease (NICD) and external organisations and institutes. (Photo : A health camp
at Akkarapettai Villager in Nagapattinam District-December 2004)
4.17.2 Post-disaster management of health, sanitation and hygiene services is crucial to prevent
an outbreak of epidemics. The draft Public Health (Prevention, Control and Management of
Epidemics, Bio-terrorism and Disasters) Bill prepared by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare
is under consideration for enactment.
4.17.3 National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme (NVBDCP) is the key programme
for prevention/control of outbreaks/epidemics of malaria, dengue, chikungunya etc., vaccines
administered to reduce the morbidity and mortality due to diseases like measles, diphtheria,
pertussis, poliomyelitis etc. Two key measures to prevent/control epidemics of water-borne
diseases like cholera, viral hepatitis etc. include making available safe water and ensuring
personal and domestic hygienic practices are adopted.
4.17.4 It is impossible to always prevent epidemics, but its impact can always be mitigated by
anticipating them and by being prepared. Epidemic preparedness and response is a multisectoral and multi-agency activity. Health sector plays a lead role in preparing and executing
the epidemic preparedness plan but need the expertise and support of other disciplines/sectors
also. Planning process will inter alia require extensive review of health infrastructure, disease
surveillance and response system, availability of laboratories, trained professionals, drugs,
vaccines and equipment in the country, communication system, coordinating mechanism
between different sectors and between the national and international agencies and legal issues.
4.17.5 Accordingly, Govt. of India launched Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) in
November 2004 to strengthen capacity at state/district levels to detect and respond to the
epidemics in early rising phase. Under the project, the district and states have been strengthened
by providing additional technical manpower (epidemiologists, microbiologists, entomologists),
training of rapid response teams for outbreak investigation and control, strengthening of
laboratories for detection of organisms causing epidemic prone diseases, and establishment of
IT network for data compilation, dissemination and analysis. The states are at varying stages of
implementation.
4.17.6 The key achievement of IDSP has been creation of capacity at sub-district/district/state
levels to detect early warning signals and outbreaks of epidemic prone diseases so that they can

97

Disaster Management in India

Medical camp during Tsunami, 2004 in Nagapattinam, Tamil Nadu

be responded early. They collect weekly surveillance data, monitor disease trends and investigate
rising in cases. About 85% of districts are reporting these data to Central Surveillance Unit
through e-mail and more than 60% report through portal. The result is that states have detected
and responded to more number of outbreaks after implementation of IDSP. For example, a total
of 553 outbreaks were reported and responded to by states in 2008, 799 outbreaks in 2009 and
990 outbreaks in 2010. Earlier not many outbreaks were reported in the country by the States/
UTs.
4.17.7 Finally, a mention must be made about the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005
which were adopted by the 58th World Health Assembly in May 2005 and came into force on 15
June 2007 (in India on 8 August 2007). IHR (2005) also provide us an opportunity to strengthen
core capacities to detect, assess and notify and control all public health emergencies of
international concern (PHEIC). These capacities will also help us to control endemic infectious
diseases which may not spread to other countries.

4.18 Measures taken for Rail Safety
Several measures have been taken to improve safety of Rail Transportation which is summarised
as below:
4.18.1 Special Railway Safety Fund (SRSF): Arising out of an important recommendation of
Railway Safety Review Committee (RSRC) (Khanna Committee), to pull up the backlog of arrears
for track renewals, bridges, rolling stock and signaling gear within a fixed time frame, a nonlapsable ‘Special Railway Safety Fund’ of ` 17000 crores was set up with effect from 01.10.2001
with a contribution from the Ministry of Finance and Railways. Works related to replacement /
renewal of over-aged bridges, signaling gears and replacement of narrow gauge locomotives is
ongoing.

98

Prevention and Mitigation
4.18.2 Corporate Safety Plan (2003-2013): Railway Safety Review Committee (1998), in
its report recommended that railways formulate a safety plan with the following broad
objectives:
•

To achieve reduction in rate of accidents per million train kilometers from  0.44 (in 2002-03)
to 0.17 by the year 2013,

•

Implement measures to reduce chances of passenger fatality substantially in consequential
train accidents by 2013,

•

Focus on development of manpower through major improvements in working environment
and training to reduce the accidents attributable to human failure by 40 percent by 2013,

•

Achieve safety culture on all fronts including maintenance depots, worksites, stations,
controls etc.,

•

Progressively achieve an environment of “fail-proof” from the present “fail-safe” system of
asset failures by upgrading the systems by 2013, and

•

Prioritisation of safety related projects.

It is estimated that index of accidents per million train kilometers would be reduced from 0.44
(in 2002-03) to 0.17 in 2012-13. Similarly, the performance indices targets have been laid down
for track defects, coach defects/ failures, wagon detachments/ failure, poor brake power (goods),
incidence of train parting (goods), motive power defects, signal defects/ failures, communication
failures and OHE (Overhead Equipment) defects.
4.18.3 Measures taken to reduce Derailments: Several measures have been taken to reduce
the derailment such as
•

Replacement of over-aged tracks, bridges, gears and rolling stock,

•

Gradual phasing out of derailment prone four wheeler tank wagons,

•

Reduction in Thermit welded joints on rails, use of SPURT Cars for rail flaw detection,

•

Track circulation for enhanced safety in train operations,  

•

Introduction of Self Propelled Accident Relief Medical Van (SPARMV) and Wheel Impact Load
Detector (WILD).

4.18.4 Measures taken to reduce Collisions; Similarly several measures are under
implementation for reducing the incidents of collision which may be summarised such as;
•

Extensive training to train operations staff

•

Improved maintenance and safety checks

•

Improvement in design of rolling stocks

•

Installation of Anti Collision Device (ACD).  ACD has been installed on 1900 Route kms. of
Northeast Frontier Railway Railway and 800 route kms. on Konkan Railway Corporation
Limited and put under trial. Decision has been taken to extend ACD to Southern Railway,
South Central Railway and South Western Railway on a trial basis.

4.18.5 Measures taken to reduce level crossing accidents: Railway track have been jig jagging
across the country side have rendered vulnerability profile of the people living near tracks very
high. Following measures are underway to reduce accidents arising out of crossing them.

99

Disaster Management in India
•

Social awareness programmes have been launched in rural areas through divisions,

•

Construction of Road Over Bridges (ROBs)/Road Under Bridges (RUBs) at level crossing with
Train Vehicle Units (TVUs) > 1 lakh, limited use subways to replace level crossings,

•

Manning of unmanned level crossings,

•

Interlocking and provision of phones at level crossing gates,

•

Trial of Train Actuated Warning Device (TAWD).

4.18.6 Measures taken to reduce fire accidents: Following measures have been taken to reduce
the fire accidents,
•

Provision of fire retardant material in new coaches and retro-fitment in existing coaches,

•

Emergency exits have been introduced in coaches to reduce fatalities,

•

Provision of electrical fire sensing and extinguishing system in rolling stock and stationary
installations,

•

Provision of electrical fire sensing and extra quashing system in rolling stock and stationary
installations.

4.19. Road
4.19.1 The main thrust of accident prevention and control across the world has been on the four
“E”s , namely,
(i) Education
(ii) Enforcement
(iii) Engineering
(iv Environment and Emergency care of road accident victims.
4.19.2 The measures taken by Government of India to reduce the risk of road accidents are
summarised as follows:
i.

Road Engineering: These are design/specification related aspects of roads and highways
to enhance road safety. The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) is ensuring usage
of road safety furniture and has taken a number of steps to enhance safety of road users.
The safety measures are inbuilt in the projects during design, construction, operations and
maintenance.

ii.

Enforcement: The state governments and UTs are to take measures for enforcing the statutory
provisions provided under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and the Central Motor Vehicle Rules,
1989. The enforcement measures under the said statute provides for inspection, licensing
and verification of fitness of vehicles.

iii. Education and Training: These primarily involve spreading road safety awareness and
imparting training to drivers. The initiatives undertaken in the field of training are refresher
training for heavy vehicle drivers and providing financial assistance to states/UTs for setting
up model driving schools to turn out well trained drivers.
iv. Faster relief and evacuation of road accident victims: In order to reduce the
trauma and probability of death and disability associated with the road accidents,
National Highway Accident Relief Service Scheme has been initiated which provides
for supply of cranes and ambulances to states/UTs and NGOs for relief, rescue and

100

Prevention and Mitigation
evacuation of accident victims to the closest medical centre and for clearing the
accident site.
v.

Another measure is medical care in which financial assistance upto `1.50 crores was
provided to the state government hospitals located on national highways for upgradation
and strengthening of emergency facilities

vi. Road Safety Audit: The specific aim of the road safety audit is to minimise the risk and
safety of accidents on the national highways and expressways.

4.20 Civil Aviation
4.20.1 The Directorate General Civil Aviation (DGCA) has the regulatory responsibility for
aviation safety. Its mandate is to ensure the highest level of safety in the Indian Aviation System
by employing International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards and recommended
practices. Mindful of India’s State Safety Programme (SSP), DGCA is to maintain an integrated set
of regulations and activities aimed at enhancing aviation safety.
4.20.2 DGCA implements proactive and as far as possible predictive strategies, for encouraging
all stakeholders and service providers to understand the benefits of a safety culture, which are
based on an inclusive reporting culture. DGCA fosters and assists stakeholders in developing
comprehensive Safety Management Systems (SMS) and develops preventive safety strategies
for the aviation system in an environment of a “just culture”. DGCA works with service providers
in a cooperative and collaborative manner to help them develop and establish their safety
management systems.
4.20.3 The responsibility for coordination and search and rescue (SAR) with other agencies is,
however vested with the Airports Authority of India (AAI) under the Airports Authority of India
Act, 1944, as amended by AAI (Amendment) Rules, 2003.
4.20.4 The SSP is based on comprehensive analysis of the States Aviation System, safety policies,
risk management, safety assurances and permission.
4.20.5 An appropriate legislative framework in safety management has been implemented in
India in accordance with ICAO Standard and Recommended Practices (SARPs). For carrying out
ICAO functions, India has three layers of legislation - the Aircraft Act 1934 which is the primary
legislation, the secondary Aircraft Rules, 1937 and the tertiary Aircraft (Carriage of Dangerous
Goods) Rules, 2003.
4.20.6 The DGCA has released a series of Safety Management System-Civil Aviation Regulation
(SMS-CARs) about operational regulations and implementation policies for the applicable
service providers.

4.21 Conclusion
Effective planning and focus on prevention and mitigation would greatly help in ensuring that
the hazards do not transform itself into disasters and the coping capacities of the vulnerable
population is greatly increased. This would again need systematic planning and coordination to
ensure that the Disaster Risk Reduction is constantly promoted and mainstreamed in the regular
programmes of each department. Recently planning commission has constituted a committee
for inclusion of DRR measures in the 12th five year plan.

Preparedness
and Response

5.1 Introduction
5.1.1 Facing disaster by way of mitigation, prevention, preparedness, response, evacuation,
relief and rehabilitation has been part of the administrative ethos. India has a long history
of rendering relief in an organized fashion in times of drought and famine. The states have
antiquated relief code which deals with the general principles of administration of relief. It starts
with the responsibility of the Government for combating distress, defining scope of object of
such measures etc. India, with a vast agrarian economy in the past had focused on distress relief
mainly related to agricultural activities. Preparedness included collection of statistical data on
the rainfall, weather conditions, crop pattern activities relating to management of cattle etc.
The relief work focused on departmental work and village work for generation of employment
during drought. With the changing pattern of disaster and with the introduction of technology,
material and new financial terms into disaster management, several modifications have been
incorporated in the administrative measures for relief work
5.1.2 The scope of disaster has since changed and so the response thereto. With the constitution
of successive Finance Commission under the provision of the Constitution, the measures for
relief and the scope of disaster have enlarged. An attempt has been made in the succeeding
paragraphs to capture the information relating to timely prediction/forecasting of different kind
of disasters and development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for responding such
disasters.

5.2 Institutional Arrangements
5.2.1 Forecasting about climate change is pre requisite for taking preparedness measure to
respond to the disaster is the most important element of disaster management. The Ministry
of Environment & Forest (MoEF), Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Ministry of Science &
Technology (MST), Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), Ministry of Water Resources (MWR), Ministry
of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Ministry of Non-conventional Energy (MNES),
Defence Research & Development Organization (DRDO), Ministry of Defence (MoD), Ministry
of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and Indian
Meteorological Department (IMD) promote and undertake climate and climate change related
research in the country.

5.3 India Meteorological Department (IMD)
5.3.1 Modernized meteorological observations and research in India was initiated more than 200
year ago, since 1793, when the first Indian Meteorological observatory was set up at Madras
(now Chennai). IMD was formally established in 1875 with a network of about 90 weather
observatories for systematic observation and research.
5.3.2 India Meteorological Department’s tradition of monitoring weather and climate spans
more than 135 years giving it a sound and useful dataset to fall back upon for environmental
assessment. Ozone monitoring network was started as a globally pioneering effort as early as in
1954 realizing that this trace gas plays a very important role in atmospheric chemical mechanisms.
It also started radiation measurements about 50 year back and currently maintaining 45 stations
in the country for providing exclusive countrywide dataset for assessment of solar energy
resources.
5.3.3 A network of 10 Global Atmosphere Watch Stations (GAW, formerly Background Air Pollution
Monitoring Network or BAPMoN) consisting of Allahabad, Jodhpur, Kodaikanal, Minicoy,
Mohanbari, Port Blair, Pune, Nagpur, Srinagar and Vishakhapatnam, is maintained by IMD as per
WMO protocols and standards since 1974 to generate data and information on the exchange of
trace materials between the atmosphere and the earth’s surface, making atmospheric turbidity
and air quality measurements to quantify trends and acid rain threats.
5.3.4 Atmospheric monitoring: There are 25 types of atmospheric monitoring networks
that are operated and coordinated by the IMD. This includes meteorological, climatologically,
environment, air pollution and other specialized observation of atmospheric trace constituents.
It maintains 559 surface meteorological observatories, about 35 radio-stations and 64 pilot
balloon stations for monitoring the upper atmosphere. Specialized observations are made for
agro meteorological purposes at 219 stations and radiation parameters are monitored at 45
stations. There are about 70 observatories that monitor current weather conditions for aviation.
The IMD collects meteorological data over oceans by an establishment of cooperation fleet of
Voluntary Observing Ships (VOF) comprising merchant ships of Indian registry, some foreign
merchant vessels and a few ships of the Indian Navy. These ships, while sailing on the high seas,
function as floating observatories. Records of observations are passed on to the IMD for analysis
and archival.

5.4. Forecast of Rainfall
5.4.1 India receives 80 per cent of its annual rainfall during the southwest monsoon season of
June to September. Rainfall over the country during this season shows a wide range of spatial
variation due to orographic influences and preferential occurrence of rain-bearing systems in
certain regions. India has a very extensive rain gauge network and rainfall monitoring over the
country.
5.4.2 The real-time monitoring and statistical analysis of district wise daily rainfall is one of the
important functions of the IMD at New Delhi. Based on the real time daily rainfall data, weekly
district wise, sub-division wise and state wise rainfall distribution summaries are prepared
regularly by the Rainfall Monitoring Unit. Maps showing weekly and cumulative rainfall figures
in 36 meteorological subdivisions of the country are prepared. This information is very important
to many user agencies, particularly for agricultural planning.

104

Preparedness and Response

5.5. Forecasting System - Background
5.5.1 India Meteorological Department (IMD) follows a two-stage forecasting strategy for long
range forecasting of the south-west monsoon season rainfall over the country as a whole. The
Long Period Average (LPA) of the south-west monsoon season rainfall over the country as a
whole for the period 1951-2000 is 89cm. The first long range forecast for the south-west monsoon
season (June-September) rainfall is issued in April and the forecast update is issued in June.
From 2007 onwards, IMD has been using the following statistical models for preparing
quantitative and probabilistic forecasts of the south-west monsoon rainfall (June – September)
for the country as a whole:
a.

A 5- parameter statistical ensemble forecasting system requiring data up to March, for the
first forecast in April.

b.

A 6- parameter statistical ensemble forecasting system requiring data up to May for the
forecast update in June. Three of these 6-parameters are same as that used for April forecast.

For preparing the first stage forecast for the 2011 South-west monsoon rainfall for the country as
a whole presented here, the 5-parameter statistical ensemble forecasting system has been used.
5.5.2 Operational Statistical Forecast System: In the IMD’s Ensemble Statistical Forecasting
system for April forecast, the following 5 predictors are used. The model error of the April
forecasting systems is ±5%.
Table 5.1: Model error of the April forecasting systems

3

East Asia Mean Sea Level Pressure

February + March

4

NW Europe Land Surface Air Temperature

5

Equatorial Pacific Warm Water Volume

The 5-parameter ensemble statistical forecasting system was also used to prepare probability
forecasts for five pre-defined rainfall categories. These are deficient (less than 90% of LPA), below
normal (90-96% of LPA), normal (96-104% of LPA), above normal (104-110% of LPA) and excess
(above 110% of LPA). The forecasted probabilities in percentage based on this system for the
above 5 categories are 6%, 30%, 53%, 10% and 1% respectively.
5.5.3 Experimental Forecasts: IMD has an experimental dynamical forecast system. The
experimental ensemble dynamical forecast for the 2011 south-west monsoon rainfall was
computed as the ensemble average of 10 member forecasts with forecasted sea surface
temperatures (SST) as boundary SST forcing.
In addition, IMD takes into account the experimental forecasts prepared by the national institutes
like Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Space
Applications Centre, Ahmedabad, National Aerospace Laboratories, Bangalore, Centre for
Mathematical Modelling and Computer Simulation, Bangalore, National Centre for Medium
Range Weather Forecasting, Noida and Center for Development of Advanced Computing, Pune.

105

Disaster Management in India
Operational/experimental forecasts prepared by international institutes like the National Centers
for Environmental Prediction, USA, International Research Institute for Climate and Society, USA,
Meteorological Office, UK, the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts, UK , the
Experimental Climate Prediction Center, USA, and World Meteorological Organization’s Lead
Centre for Long Range Forecasting - Multi-Model Ensemble were also taken into account.
The experimental forecasts from majority of the statistical and dynamical models suggest below
normal to normal monsoon season rainfall over the country as a whole.
5.5.4 Sea Surface Temperature Conditions over the equatorial Pacific & Indian Oceans: The
El Niño conditions that were originated since June, 2009 peaked in December 2009 and then
started to weaken to reach ENSO-neutral conditions in May, 2010. This continued till mid June
when weak La Nina conditions emerged. The La Niña conditions strengthened subsequently
and become moderate to strong during mid-August 2010 to early February 2011. The La Nina
conditions since have weakened to weak to moderate strength as of mid-March 2011. The latest
forecasts from a majority of the dynamical and statistical models indicate strong probability for
the present La Niña conditions to continue till June. Subsequently the La Nina conditions are
expected to weaken further to reach ENSO- neutral conditions. However, it may be mentioned
that the climate forecasts prepared at this time of the year has large uncertainty.
It is important to note that in addition to ENSO events, other factors such as the Indian Ocean Sea
surface temperatures (SSTs) have also significant influence on Indian monsoon. Recent forecasts
from some coupled models suggest possibility of the development of a weak negative Indian
Ocean Dipole event during the second half of the year, which may not have much impact on the
Indian monsoon.
As the extreme sea surface temperature conditions over Pacific and Indian Oceans particularly
ENSO conditions over Pacific (El Nino or La Nina) are known to have strong influence on the
Indian summer monsoon, IMD is carefully monitoring the sea surface conditions over Pacific and
Indian oceans.
5.5.5 Forecast for the 2011 South-west monsoon rainfall: IMD’s long range forecast for the
2011 south-west monsoon season (June to September) is that the rainfall for the country as a
whole is most likely to be Normal (96-104% of Long Period Average (LPA)). There is very low
probability for season rainfall to be deficient (below 90% of LPA) or excess (above 110% of LPA).
Quantitatively, monsoon season rainfall is likely to be 98% of the LPA with a model error of ±
5%. The LPA of the season rainfall over the country as a whole for the period 1951-2000 is 89 cm.
IMD will update the above forecast in June 2011 as a part of the second stage forecast. Along
with the update forecast, separate forecasts for the monthly (July and August) rainfall over the
country as a whole and seasonal (June-September) rainfall over the four geographical regions of
India will also be issued. Forecast for the rainfall over the country as a whole during the second
of the season (August + September) will be issued in July and that for September will be issued
in August.

5.6 Forecasting and Warning of Cyclones
5.6.1 IMD is the nodal agency in the country to monitor and predict the cyclonic disturbances
and issue the warning and advisory bulletins. IMD, New Delhi also acts as a Regional
Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) for providing tropical cyclone advisories to the World

106

Preparedness and Response
Meteorological Organization (WMO)/ Economic and Social Cooperation for Asia and the Pacific
(ESCAP) Panel members countries viz Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Maldives,
Pakistan and Oman. IMD, New Delhi also works as a Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre (TCAC) for
international civil aviation as per the requirement of International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO)
5.6.2 The cyclone warning are issued to State Government officials in four stages: i.e.
(i) pre-cyclone watch issued 72 hours in advance,
(ii) cyclone alert issued at least 48 hours in advance ,
(iii) cyclone warning issued at least 24 hours in advance, and
(iv) as post landfall outlook issued at least 12 hours in advance of expected time of landfall.
IMD has prepared roadmap for cyclonegenesis and further intensification, monitoring and
prediction.

5.7. Flood Forecasting – Central Water Commission27
5.7.1 The flood forecasting and warning system is used for alerting the likely damage centre well
in advance of the actual arrival of floods, to enable the people to move and also to remove the
moveable property to safer places or to raised platforms specially constructed for the purpose.
5.7.2 A beginning in scientific flood forecasting was made in November, 1958 by CWC (then
known as Central Water & Power Commission) when a Flood Forecasting Centre was set up at
its Headquarters, at Delhi for giving timely Forecasts and Warnings of the incoming floods to
the villages located in the river areas around the National Capital, Delhi. The network has been
expanding and by now the Flood Forecasting Network of the CWC covers the entire major flood
prone inter State basins in the country.
5.7.3 The flood forecasting involves the following four main activities:
(i) observation and collection of hydrological and hydro meteorological data,
(ii) transmission of Data to forecasting centres,
(iii) analysis of data and formulation of forecast, and
(iv) Dissemination of forecast.
5.7.4 On an average 6000 forecasts at various places in the country are issued during the monsoon
seasons every year. The analysis of the forecasts issued during the last 25 years (1978 to 2002)
indicates that accuracy of forecasts has consistently increased from around 81% to 98%. Forecast
is considered accurate if forecast water level is within + 15 cm of actual water level of the inflow
forecast (i.e. discharge) and is within + 20% of actual discharge.
5.7.5 In monitoring the floods, severity of floods are placed in the following four categories by
the CWC
(i) Low Flood stage – It is that flood situation when the water level of the river is flowing
between warning level and danger level of the forecasting stations.
(ii) Medium flood stage – The river is called in medium floods when its water level is at or above
the danger level of the forecasting station but below 0.50 of its highest flood level (HFL)

107

Disaster Management in India
(iii) High flood state – When the water level of the river is below the HFL but within 0.50 m of the
HFL of the forecasting stations.
(iv) Unprecedented flood stage – The river is called in unprecedented floods when it attains
water level equal to or above its previous HFL at any forecasting stations.
5.7.6 A computerized monitoring system has been developed under which daily water levels as
observed at 0800 hours and forecasts issued by field units are transmitted to CWC headquarters
in New Delhi. Based on the compilation of all such data received from field divisions, daily
water level and flood forecast bulletins in two parts for stage and for inflow forecasting stations
respectively.

5.8 Tsunami warning – Indian National Centre for Oceanic Information System
(INCOIS)28
5.8.1 Post tsunami dated 26th December, 2004, Ministry of Earth Sciences has established the
Indian National Tsunami Warning System at Indian National Centre for Ocean Information
Services (INCOIS), Hyderabad. The Tsunami Early Warning System (TEWS) was made operational
on 15th Oct 2007. This agency has developed a protocol for issue for Tsunami Watch, Alert and
Warnings. The Centre gives information to all responders about the origin, time, location of
the epicenter, magnitude and depth of an earthquake inside the ocean and accordingly issues
bulletins.
5.8.2 The system is capable of detecting all earthquake events of more than 6 Magnitude
occurring in the Indian Ocean in less than 20 minutes of occurrence and first report on the
occurrence of an earthquake in India and the Indian Ocean region to sent to MHA within 2530 minutes indicating the location and magnitude of the earthquake. Further, if any rise in
water level is reported by NIOT, TEWC would issue a Tsunami warning within 60 minutes of the
occurrence of the earthquake. The information so generated would be disseminated through
various communication channels to the concerned user agencies in a fully automated mode.

5.9 Warning about Landslide hazard – Geological Survey of India (GSI)
5.9.1 Geological Survey of India (GSI), established in 1851 is a government organization under the
Union Ministry of Mines with the Headquarter at New Delhi for conducting geological surveys
and studies. It is one of the oldest of such organizations in the world.
5.9.2 The GSI was designated as nodal agency for coordinating geological studies, landslides
hazard zonation, monitoring landslides, avalanches, studying the factors responsible and
suggesting precautionary and preventive measure on 29th January, 2004. The input from GSI
as nodal agency help the Ministries and Departments concerned in the Central Government
as well as the State Government for taking appropriate preventive and mitigation measures for
reducing landslide hazard and responding in the mountainous areas and hill in the Himalayan
and sub Himalayan regions. GSI is the nodal agency responsible for early warning relating to the
landslides in the country.
5.9.3 Study of Land Contour by GSI: Geological Survey of India (GSI) studies the shape and
material of the land getting inundated and generates data on area, shape, slope, infiltration and
permeability of soil of the basin, drainage pattern, landform and longitudinal and cross profiles
of the channels. On the basis of these studies, GSI produces flood hazard maps indicating

108

Preparedness and Response
Prohibitive, Restricted, Cautionary and Flood Free Zones. Significant flood related studies and
recommendations made by GSI are as follows:
• Brahmaputra Valley - a comprehensive geo-environmental data base for environmental
management and flood control generated,
• Lower Banas sub-basin - selective irrigation to prevent rise of groundwater table recommended,
• Kandi basin in West Bengal-  GSI recommended construction of small weirs to reduce impact
of flood,
• Mokameh Tal area in the Ganga Flood plain - rejuvenation of existing drainage channels to
reduce flood problem recommended,
• Lower Damodar Basin- diversion along artificial canals and re-excavation of old river channel
recommended,
• Landslide zonation map for Himalayan region,
• The contribution of snow melting to annual flood.
GSI’s flood related studies are used by Central Water Commission, Water Resource Development
Project Authorities, Urban and Rural Planning Authorities, Ministry of Environment and Forest,
Ministry of Agriculture, etc.

5.10 Avalanche warning – Defence Research & Development Organization (DRDO) 29
5.10.1 DRDO was formed in 1958 with the amalgamation of the then already functioning technical
development establishments of the Indian Army and the Directorate of Technical Development
and projection with the Defence Science Organization. DRDO was then a small organization with
10 establishment or laboratories. Over the years it has grown as multi directionally in terms of the
Variety of disciplines, number of laboratories, achievements and stature.
5.10.2 Today network of more than fifty laboratories are deeply engaged in developing
Defence technologies. Center for Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE) is one of
the laboratories of the DRDO located at Chandigarh with its primary function to do research in
the field of snow and avalanches and to provide avalanche control measures and forecasting
support to Armed forces. The SASE is the nodal agency for issuing advisories and warnings about
the avalanche in the country.

5.11 Disaster Management Support (DMS) – Indian Space Research Organization
(ISRO) 30
5.11.1
The Space activities in the country started during early 1960s with the
scientific investigation of upper atmosphere and ionosphere over the magnetic equator that
passes over Thumba near Thiruvananthapuram using small sounding rockets Realising the
immense potential of space technology for national development, Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, the
visionary leader envisioned that this powerful technology could play a meaningful role in
national development and solving the problems of common man.
5.11.2 The objective of ISRO is to develop space technology and its application to various
national tasks. ISRO has established two major space systems, INSAT for communication,
television broadcasting and meteorological services, and Indian Remote Sensing Satellites (IRS)
system for resources monitoring and management. ISRO has developed two satellite launch
vehicles, PSLV and GSLV, to place INSAT and IRS satellites in the required orbits. Accordingly, ISRO

109

Disaster Management in India
has successfully operationalised two major satellite systems namely Indian National Satellites
(INSAT) for communication services and Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites for management
of natural resources; also, Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) for launching IRS type of satellites
and Geostationary Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) for launching INSAT type of satellites.
5.11.3 The Disaster Management Support (DMS) Programme of ISRO, provides timely support
and services from aero-space systems, both imaging and communications, towards efficient
management of disasters in the country.. The DMS programme addresses disasters such as
flood, cyclone, drought, forest fire, landslide and Earthquake. These include creation of digital
data base for facilitating hazard zonation, damage assessment, etc., monitoring of major natural
disasters using satellite and aerial data; development of appropriate techniques and tools for
decision support, establishing satellite based reliable communication network, deployment of
emergency communication equipments and R&D towards early warning of disasters.
5.11.4 To support the total cycle of disaster (emergency) management for the country in near real
time, the database creation is addressed through National Database for Emergency Management
(NDEM), a GIS based repository of data. NDEM is envisaged to have core data, hazard-specific
data and dynamic data in spatial as well as spatial form.
5.11.5 Airborne ALTM-DC data acquisition is being carried out for the flood prone basins in the
country. The development of flight model of C band DMSAR is nearing completion. SAR data was
acquired over selected basins using Development model of DMSAR. Towards providing emergency
communication for disaster management activities and at the behest of Ministry of Home Affairs,
ISRO has set up a satellite based Virtual Private Network (VPN) linking the National Control Room
at MHA with DMS-DSC at NRSC, important national agencies, key Government Offices in Delhi and
the Control Rooms of 22 multi-hazard-prone States. Further ISRO has developed and deployed
INSAT Type-D terminals (portable satellite phones), INSAT based Distress Alert Transmitter (DAT)
for fishermen, Cyclone Warning Dissemination System (CWCS) and DTH based Digital Disaster
Warning System (DDWS) in disaster prone areas.
5.11.6 As part of R&D support to DMS for remote sensing applications, work on Tropical Cyclone
Track intensity and landfall prediction, Earthquake Precursor studies, Coastal Vulnerability
mapping and Early Warning of Landslides are being carried out.
5.11.8 The DMS programme is also supporting the many international initiatives by sharing data
and information. Through International Charter “Space and Major Disasters” and Sentinel Asia
(SA) initiative for supporting disaster management activities in the Asia-Pacific region, ISRO is
providing IRS datasets and other information for use during major calamities.

5.12 Radiological and Nuclear Emergencies
5.12.1 Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) is the nodal agency for providing the necessary
technical inputs to the National or local authorities for responding to any nuclear or radiological
emergency. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is the nodal ministry to coordinate with
the various response agencies in the event of any nuclear or radiological disaster in the
public domain. A Crisis Management Group (CMG) has been functioning since 1987 at DAE
for this purpose. This Group is chaired by the Additional Secretary, DAE, and has on board
expert members from different units of DAE and Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB). Each
member has an alternate member and CMG is backed by resource agencies of various units of
DAE.

110

Preparedness and Response
5.12.2 Based on the radiological conditions and their consequences, emergencies at nuclear
facilities are categorized as emergency standby, personnel emergency, plant emergency, on-site
emergency and off-site emergency. As a basic regulatory requirement, emergency preparedness
exists at all nuclear and radiation facilities to respond to any on-site or off-site emergency in
their areas. But to handle radiological emergencies arising from a transport accident or from the
movement or handling of ‘orphan source’ (radioactive sources that have lost regulatory control is
called ‘orphan sources’) or due to malevolent acts like explosion of an RDD, Radiation Exposure
Device (RED) or IND any time or anywhere in the country, a network of 18 units of Emergency
Response Centers (ERCs) has been established by Bhabha Atomic Research Center, DAE. These
ERCs are equipped with radiation monitoring instruments, protective gear and other supporting
infrastructure.

5.13 Installation of Radiological Detection Equipment
5.13.1 As a part of preparedness measure Radioactive Detection Equipments (RDE’s) are being
installed at entry and exit points in the country. On the initiatives of MHA and in consultation with
the various Stakeholders, the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) and Electric Corporation
of India Limited (ECIL) a technical survey of the entry and exit points in a phased manner was
undertake for installation of the RDE’s. The survey for installation of RDEs at 29 entry/exit points
has been identified by BARC (12 seaports, 14 airports and 3 international borders).
5.13.2 The responsibility of installation of these RDE’s rest with the concerned Ministries and
Departments as the responsibility for allocating funds for prevention, mitigation etc. for Disaster
rests with the concerned Central Ministries and Departments. As such Ministry of Shipping,
Ministry of Civil aviation and Ministry of Home Affairs are taking necessary action to carryout
installation of RDE’s in the time bound manner in consultation with BARC and ECIL. The ports /
land crossing identified for the purpose are given as follows in Box 5.2.

5.14 Director General of Mines Safety
5.14.1 Mining activity accounts for about 1% of the world employment but contributes to about
7% fatalities at the work place. In 1901 the then British Government in India established Bureau
of Mines (now Directorate General of Mines Safety) with its headquarter at Calcutta with the
object to enforce provisions of Mines Act. Till 1985, the Director General of Mines Safety was
also entrusted with the job of covering the rescue and recovery operations at mines. The Rescue
Station was headed by an Ex-officio Director of DGMS and the rescue was funded by a cess collected

111

Disaster Management in India
from the coal companies. Rescue Rules under Mines Act, 1952 were framed in 1985 according to
which standards/quantity/type of equipment/place of rescue station etc. were also governed.
5.14.2 Coal companies have provided and maintained rescue station in the heart of coal mining
areas namely at Sitarampur (WB), Dhanbad (Jharkhand), Manindragarh (Chhatisgarh), Indora
(Nagpur), Ramgarh (Jharkhand), Karimnagar (AP) etc. In case of Metalliferous sector, rescue
room at the mine level/rescue station at the company level have been provided and maintained
in the centrally located of mining areas by various companies engaged in metal mining, namely
HZL at Udaipur (Rajasthan); UCIL at Jadugoda (Jharkahnd); MOIL at Balaghat (Nagpur); HGML at
Hutti ( Karnataka); HCL at Khetri,( Rajasthan) etc.

5.15 Epidemic
5.15.1 Three core capacities are essentially required to deal with epidemics. These are
(i) Establishment/strengthening of a laboratory based disease surveillance system to collect
baseline data on infectious diseases, monitor disease trends and to detect epidemics in
early rising phase,
(ii) Development of epidemiological, clinical, entomological and laboratory capacities to
investigate the epidemics to characterize the cases in terms of time, person and place and
to understand the transmission dynamics, and
(iii) Development of response capacities to prevent/control the epidemics to reduce the
morbidity and mortality to the minimum.
5.15.2 The outbreaks/epidemics are usually investigated by the district or state Rapid Response
Teams. Several central/regional institutes like National Centre for Disease Control (formerly
National Institute of Communicable Diseases), Delhi; National Institute of Virology, Pune; National
Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, Kolkata; Vector Control Research Centre, Puducherry
and other ICMR institutes provide epidemiological, laboratory and entomological support to
the states for investigation and control when the outbreaks/epidemics are widespread and
states request for assistance. Also there is increasing collaboration with Department of Animal
Husbandry in managing emerging zoonotic diseases such as avian influenza and Crimean Congo
Hemorrhagic fever.

5.16 Preparedness
5.16.1 Annual Conference of Relief Commissioners and Secretaries of States
and UTs: An annual Conference of Relief Commissioners, Secretaries, to the Department of
Disaster Management of States and UTs is organized before the onset of south west monsoon
to review the status of preparedness for ensuing Monsoon and to discuss other disaster
management related issues. The representatives of various Central Ministries, Organizations
rendering Emergency Support Functions besides representatives of Central Para-Military Forces
also participate.
5.16.2 Issue of guidelines: Necessary guidelines in the form of checklist as given in Box 5.3, for
taking necessary preparatory measures are issued to the State for their guidance and appropriate
action. Instructions are also issued for creating reserves of essential items required during rescue
and relief phase.

5.17 Trigger Mechanism
This mechanism has been developed to activate the disaster response system automatically after
receiving warning signals of a disaster happening or likely to happen or on receipt of information
about the incident. The responders are required to undertake activities as per the SOPs issued in
respect of such disasters. There may be scenario where early warning signals could be available
and there may happen a disaster without any early warning.

5.18 Crisis Management Plan (CMP) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
5.18.1 In accordance with National Crisis Management Plan 2003 of the Cabinet Secretariat, MHA
has formulated its CMP 2004 and circulated it to all States and UTs. The CMP of MHA comprises
of two parts; Part-I deals with aspects, which are common to all contingencies situations and
Part-II about the individual Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for dealing with specific crisis
situation. SOPs are preparedness plan which emerges and activates the procedure for response
on receipt of calamity or receipt of figure of impending disaster. It identifies the financial and
administration powers to the people made responsible for the procedure.
5.18.2 The CMP of MHA is reviewed periodically. It was last reviewed in 2009 and was circulated
to all Ministries and Departments of Central Government as well as States and UTs. An SOP for
management of Natural Disasters formulated by this Ministry has also been circulated vide this
Ministry’s letter No.32-35/2003-NDM-I dated 21-04-2009.
5.18.3 The State Governments have been advised to formulate the similar kind of the CMP and
SOPs. MHA has conducted number of training workshops for the States and UTs for assisting
them in formulation of the SOPs.

5.19 Role and Responsibility of Central and State Governments
5.19.1 Ministry of Home Affairs is the nodal Ministry for management of natural disasters (other
than drought, hailstorm and pest attack, which are handled by Ministry of Agriculture) on behalf
of the Government of India. Disaster Management Division (DM Division) performs the function
in the Ministry of Home Affairs.
5.19.2 The Central and State Governments are jointly responsible for undertaking relief,
rehabilitation, preparedness, mitigation and response measures. The basic responsibility for
undertaking these measures in the event of a disaster rests with the concerned State Government.
The Central Government supplements the efforts of the State Governments by providing logistic
and financial support in case of natural calamities of severe nature. The logistic support includes

113

Disaster Management in India
deployment of aircrafts and boats, specialist teams of Armed Forces, Central Paramilitary Forces
and personnel of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), arrangements for relief materials &
essential commodities including medical stores, restoration of critical infrastructure facilities
including communication network and such other assistance as may be required by the affected
States to meet the situation effectively.
5.19.3 DM Division of MHA closely monitors the disaster and disaster like situation to facilitate
strategic interventions in the form of logistic and financial support by the Government of India
to augment the resources of the affected States and UTs to deal effectively with each disaster
situation. For this purpose close liaison is made with the affected States on the one side and the
concerned Central line Ministries such as Ministry of Health, Ministry of Defence Ministry of Civil
Aviation, Food and Civil Supplies etc on the other.

5.20 Inter Agency Co-ordination Mechanism
Co-ordination at the Central and the State level is achieved by way of various committees
involving all departments that are working in Disaster management. A response set-up across
the country may be viewed in Figure 5.1.

5.21 Cabinet Committee on Management of Natural Calamities
It is constituted to
• Oversee all aspects relating to management of natural calamities including assessment of the
situation and identification of measures considered necessary to reduce its impact,
• Examine and implement programmes for reducing the adverse impact of natural calamities,
• Monitor and suggest long term measures for prevention of such calamities in the future; and,
• Formulate and recommend programmes for public awareness for building up society’s
resilience to natural calamities.
The Committee is to be serviced by Ministry of Home Affairs in all cases except in cases relating to
Drought Management and Epidemics when it is serviced, as the case may be, by the Department
of Agriculture and Cooperation and Department of Health and Family Welfare.

5.22 National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC)
At the Centre, under the Chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary the NCMC has been constituted
in the Cabinet Secretariat. The other members of this Committee include the Secretary to the
Prime Minister, Secretaries of the Ministries of Home Affairs, Defence, Information & Broadcasting,

information from the nodal officers on measures relating to the above. The Joint Secretary (DM)
is the Convener of CMG for natural disasters.

5.24 Role of the State Government
5.24.1 In the context of federal set-up of India, the responsibility to formulate the Governments
response to a natural calamity is essentially that of the concerned State Government. However,
the Central Government, with its resources, physical and financial does provide the needed help
and assistance to buttress relief efforts in the wake of major natural disasters. The dimensions
of the response at the level of National Government are determined in accordance with the
existing policy of financing the relief expenditure and keeping in view the factors like.
(i) gravity of a natural calamity,
(ii) scale of the relief operation necessary, and
(iii) Requirements of Central assistance for augmenting the financial resources at the disposal of
the State Government.
5.24.2 Most of the States have Relief Commissioners under the Department of Disaster
Management, who are in charge of the relief measures in the wake of natural disasters. In the
absence of the Relief Commissioner, the Chief Secretary or an Officer nominated by him is in
overall charge of the Relief operations in the concerned State.
5.24.3 At the state level, the State Relief Commissioner supervises and controls relief operations
through Collectors or Deputy Commissioners, who are the main functionaries to coordinate the
relief operation at district level. The State Governments are autonomous in organizing relief
operations in the event of natural disasters and in developing the long-term rehabilitation
measures. The State Government’s efforts are supplemented by central Government based on
the recommendations of the Finance Commission.

5.25 State Crisis Management Group (SCMG)
5.25.1 There is a State Crisis Management Group (SCMG) under the Chairmanship of Chief
Secretary and Relief Commissioner. This Group comprises senior officers from the Departments
of Revenue/relief, Home, Civil Supplies, Power, Irrigation, Water Supply, Panchayat (local selfgovernment), Agriculture, Forests, rural Development, and health, Planning, Public Works and
Finance.
5.25.2 The SCMG is required to take into consideration the guidance received, from time to time,
from Government of India and formulate action plans for dealing with different natural disasters.
It is also the duty of the Relief Commissioner of the State to establish a Emergency Operation
Center (Control Room) at State headquarters as soon as a disaster situation develops. Besides
having all updated information on forecasting and warning of disaster, the EOC would also be
the contact point for the various concerned agencies.

5.26 Role of District Administration
5.26.1 The district Administration is the focal point for field level organizations. It is responsible
for implementation of all government contingency plans. Considerable powers have therefore
been wrested upon the District Collector to carry out operations in the shortest possible time.

116

Preparedness and Response
5.26.2 The District Administration in the country is required to prepare an advance Contingency
Plan depending on the type of disaster likely to affect the district. Contingency Plans are to
follow a framework as laid down nationally which comprises type of preparedness, the relief
material required to be mobilized and the concerned departments that need to work together
and provide an efficient feedback and monitoring system.
5.26.3 The District Magistrate exercises coordinating and supervisory powers over functionaries
of all the Departments at the district level in the event of emergencies. During actual operations
for disaster mitigation or relief, the powers of the Collector are considerably enhanced, generally,
by standing instructions or orders on the subject, or by specific Governments orders, if so required.
Sometimes, the administrative culture of the State concerned permits, although informally, the
collector to exercise higher powers in emergency situations and the decisions are later ratified
by the competent authority.
5.26.4 District Relief Committee: The district level Relief Committee consisting of official and
non-official members including the local Legislators and the Members of Parliament reviews the
relief measures.

5.27 Role of Sub-district Administration
A District is sub-divided into sub-divisions and Tehsils or Talukas. The head of a sub-division
is called the Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO) while the head of a Tehsil is generally known as the
Tehsildar (Talukdar or Mamlatdar in some States). Contact with the individual villages is through
the village Officer or Patwari who has one or more villages in his charge. When a disaster is
apprehended, the entire machinery of the District, including officers of technical and other
Departments, swings into action and maintains almost continuous contact with each village in
the disaster threatened area. In the case of extensive disasters like drought, contact is maintained
over a short cycle of a few days. The entire hierarchy right from the Central Government (the
Department of Agriculture and Cooperation in the Ministry of Agriculture and irrigation) to the
District level is connected by means of a telecommunication system.
Control Rooms

5.28 National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC)
5.28.1 The National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC) in the Ministry of Home Affairs
functions 24X7 to monitor the disaster or disaster like situation. Based on the feedback received
from National Forecasting Agencies viz Indian Meteorological Department, Central Water
Commission, Snow & Avalanche Study Establishment etc. advisories to the concerned States/UTs
are issued from time to time for keeping watch on the developing situation and take necessary
measures such as evacuation of the vulnerable persons, operation of relief camps, pre positioning
of essential commodities etc.
5.28.2 During the south west monsoon, daily situation reports (sitreps) are prepared based on the
feedback received from the affected States and concerned Central Ministries and organizations,
and are sent to all concerned. During the calamities of severe nature, special situation reports
are also prepared and issued to all concerned. NEOC also issue SMS alerts to the concerned

officers in MHA, PMO and Cabinet Secretariat. These reports are also uploaded on the website
www.ndmindia.nic.in..

5.29 State Control Room
There is a State Level Control Room set up whenever a disaster situation develops. The Control
Room is responsible for:
(i) Transmitting information about the development of a crisis as a result of natural disaster on
continued basis to the Central Relief Commissioner.
(ii) Receiving instructions and communicating them to appropriate agencies for immediate
action.
(iii) Collection and submission of information relating to implementation of relief measures to
the Central Relief Commissioner; and
(iv) Keeping the State level authorities apprised of the developments on a continuing basis.

5.30 District Control Room
Likewise in the wake of natural disasters, a Control Room is set up in the district for day-today monitoring of the rescue and relief operations on a continuing basis, operationalising the
contingency plan and keep close liaison with the State Headquarters, NGOs and other agencies
dealing with disaster management and relief.

5.31 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)
5.31.1 Task and role of NDRF: The main task of NDRF is to provide specialist response in case of
disasters which broadly covers:
• NBC disasters ( Decontamination of the area and personnel)
• Removal of debris
• Extrication of victims- live or dead

Inadequate planning and preparation in rescue and
relief may lead to further disasters. – “42 persons die in
a stampede at Chennai flood relief camp - They came
in droves seeking relief from their tragedy, instead they
fell victim to another tragedy as a stampede on Sunday
(18th December 2005) at a relief camp for flood victims
in Chennai which left 42 people dead and 40 injured.
Hundreds of people ran for cover following a sudden
downpour and fell on each other, crushing women and
children in their wake. The tragedy occurred at 4.30
a.m. as a crowd of around 4,500 - largely poor people
- gathered in front of the locked gate of Arignar Anna
Corporation Higher Secondary School at K.K. Nagar in
west Chennai to receive food and other relief goods.
The K.K. Nagar relief camp in the school was one of 141
such camps in and around Chennai distributing relief

5.31.3 Other activities of NDRF: NDRF is engaged in following other activities beside search and
rescue operation undertaken during emergency situation.
• Conducting familiarisation exercise in order to acquaint personnel with vulnerability of their
area of responsibility to different disasters

5. 32 State Disaster Response Force (SDRF)
The States/UTs have also been advised to set up their own Specialist Response force for
responding to disasters on the lines of National Disaster Response Force vide Ministry of Home
Affairs letter dt 26th July 2007 and vide this Ministry’s letter dated 08 March 2011. The Central
Government is providing assistance for training of trainers. The State Governments have been
also advised to utilize 10% of their State Disaster Response Fund and Capacity Building Grant
for the procurement of search and rescue equipment and for training purposes of the Response
Force.

5.33 Policy for Acceptance of External Assistance
The present policy of Government of India is to not issue a formal appeal on behalf of the
Government, either directly or through any other agency, to attract relief. However, relief donated
on a voluntary basis are accepted and acknowledged as a sign of international solidarity. There
is no objection to NGO’s issuing appeals for donations provided it is clear that the appeals are
not at the instance of the Government of India. In the case of UN organisations and agencies
(like OCHA) such appeals would imply endorsement by member countries and they are advised
against appeals for international assistance.

Preparedness and Response

5.34 Drought Relief Measures
5.34.1 Management of drought has now been outlined in much elaborated manner in the
drought manual issued by ministry of Agriculture and cooperation.
5.34.2 Following drought declaration, planning and implementation of drought relief and response
measures is initiated. It is necessary that these measures are undertaken promptly so that it would
mitigate the hardship faced by the people. Though these measures are sector specific, they
require immense inter department coordination. Implementing these measures would require a
continuous flow of information from the village level to the highest level of decision making in the
State and a responsive administrative structure. It would also require careful financial planning so
that the implementation of these measures could be undertaken on a sustained basis.
5.34.3 Contingency crop planning: Ministry of Agriculture, Government of
India, Indian
Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), State Government agriculture departments and
agricultural universities need to prepare the contingency crop plan and disseminate it among
farmers with the help to support agencies, mentioned below. The alternative crop planning
involves choosing suitable crops and / or crop varieties, alternative crop strategies, mid season’s
corrections and crop life saving measures.
5.34.4 Relief employment: The most important relief component is the generation of
employment provision during the drought period. As soon as drought is declared, it is therefore,
necessary for the State Governments to immediately start relief employment programmes and
provide work to those who need employment within a radius of five kilometers.
5.34.5 Most State Governments have their own food for work programme. The Government of
India has started the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), providing 100
days of employment to one person per family on demand. The scheme has been extended to the
entire country. A large number of public works and watershed programmes could be supported
through the NREGS. These programmes together can create substantial employment to tide
over the hardship and deprivation caused by drought.
5.34.6 Water resource management: Water resource management in the drought affected
areas is one of the most critical tasks of relief operations. It requires diverse measures such as
augmentation of water supply, rationing of water use, and efficient utilization and management
of water resources, in both urban and rural areas. Shortage of water is one of the earliest indicators
of drought, affecting the entire society, rural and urban. Assessing the demand for water and its
total availability in a specific region, therefore, is extremely important for meeting the needs of
different user groups.
5.34.7 Food security Food security is one of the most important objectives of drought
management. It is provided through food for work programmes, which are started by the State
Governments to provide relief employment. Wages on these relief employment works are paid
in the form of foodgrains, on a full or partial basis.
5.34.8 The National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), extended to all the districts
across the country, guarantees employment opportunities in the rural areas by providing work
that taps labour intensive community assets. It assures manual work to one person per family for
a maximum of 100 days in a year.

121

Disaster Management in India
5.34.9 Relief through tax waivers and
concessions : The primary objective of
the tax waivers and concessions would
be to help people meet their basic
entitlements. The State Government
can take a conscious decision to
provide a number of tax waivers
and concessions when a drought
is declared. These tax waivers and
concessions should be decided on
the basis of the entitlement needs of
certain segments of the population
and the fiscal implications of such a
relief to the State Government. Each
State Government may decide on tax
waivers and concessions to the people
affected by drought, depending on
fiscal situation of the State and severity
of the drought.

situation by providing necessary
assistance for fodder, feed, and cattle
health. During a drought situation, every measure needs to be taken to save useful cattle.
When cattle wealth is seriously depleted the recovery is very slow. While sheep and goats have a
potential for rapid growth, perhaps 25% a year or more, the growth of cow, buffaloes and camels
is much slower, rarely more than 1-2% a year in a sustained manner. It is necessary to provide
support to farmers for fodder so that they do not engage in distress selling of their cattle.
5.34.11 Health and hygiene: In a drought situation, health issues are largely related to
contamination of water and spread of infection among the workers participating in public works
programmes. People have less immunity in drought situations due to poor levels of nutrition.
Necessary precautions need to be taken to prevent the spread of any water borne epidemic and
other infectious diseases.
5.34.12 Institutional response: Drought management requires a strong institutional structure
to monitor and provide a timely response to drought. While it is primarily the responsibility of the
State Government to manage drought, the Central Government also plays an important role in
monitoring drought and providing financial assistance to the States. The district administration
headed by the Collector plays the most critical role in responding to drought on the ground.
At the Central level, the Ministry of Agriculture is the department responsible for drought
monitoring and management.
5.34.13 Role of Panchayati Raj institutions: It is necessary to involve the Panchayati Raj
Institutions (PRIs) – Zila Parishads, Panchayat Samitis and village Panchayats in the implementation
of drought management programmes.

122

Preparedness and Response
5.34.14 Financing relief expenditure: In post independent India, financing relief expenditure
has largely been arranged through the Finance Commission appointed under Article 280 of the
Constitution. In the earlier phases the role of the Commission was restricted to suggesting the
pattern of financial assistance by the centre. Subsequently the recommendations were enlarged
to cover the “scheme of financing relief expenditure”.
5.34.15 Information management and media coordination :The Central and State
Governments should provide information on all aspects of drought to the people and media. It
is necessary to inform the people about the severity and impact of drought and the measures
being taken to alleviate the drought situation.

5.35 Conclusion
The preparedness and response phase in the Disaster management cycle are critical in reducing
the impact of disasters. The involvement of multi-various stakeholders, therefore, need to ensure
efficient inter-departmental coordination and need to constantly review and improve the
systems in place. It has to be kept in mind to ensure that the focus on these two areas help in
bringing a tangible improvement in handling the disasters.

Disaster Management in India

Recovery,
Reconstruction
and
Rehabilitation

6.1 Background
6.1.1 The International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) defines recovery as the “decisions
and actions taken after a disaster with a view to restore or improve the pre-disaster living
conditions of the stricken community, while encouraging and facilitating necessary adjustments
to reduce disaster risk”.
6.1.2 While emergency response is vital as it is aimed at saving human lives and providing
relief, the ultimate objective of any crisis management is restoration of devastated livelihoods.
Recovery efforts following rescue and relief in any disaster can be classified into short term and
long term. The short term activities for recovery are debris clearance, providing semi-permanent
shelter and ensuring sanitation and restoring lifelines, while the long term activities involve
building a safer and more sustainable livelihood.

6.2 Nature of Recovery
6.2.1 The damage caused by floods, earthquakes and cyclones is on a much larger scale than
other disasters and recovery after these disasters poses a challenge. In disasters like drought,
the relief phase is prolonged and since there is no damage to the infrastructure and property,
the rehabilitation is confined to restoration of livelihoods which can get subsumed in normal
development programmes.
6.2.2 Recovery in case of epidemics is more in the form of sanitising the locality against any
future recurrence and may also involve counseling of the victims. Industrial disasters being quite
varied in nature, the rehabilitation in major ones like the ‘Bhopal Gas Tragedy’ could involve
rehabilitation efforts spanning over a generation of victims apart from restoring livelihoods and
providing social and psychological assistance.
6.2.3 Rehabilitation following disasters such as landslides and avalanches is localised and is of
a similar nature as in earthquakes but on a smaller scale. Finding safer sites near such locations
often poses challenges and resistance.

6.3 Guiding Principles for Post-Recovery
Box 6.1 illustrates the principles applied generally based on international practices.
Box 6.1: Guiding Principles for Post- Recovery
• Mainstreaming disaster risk reduction in recovery and development process,
• Improving coordination,
• Promoting participatory approaches and decentralising planning and programming for recovery,
• Enhancing safety standards and integrating risk reduction in reconstruction and development,
• Improving the living conditions of the affected communities and sectors,
• Building local and national capacities for increased resilience, risk management and sustainable
development,
• Taking advantage of ongoing initiatives,
• Gender sensibility,
• Demonstrative effects,
• Monitoring, evaluation and learning.

Disaster Management in India

6.4 Assessment
The first step after stabilizing the situation by providing sufficient relief is to assess the damage.
A meticulously executed assessment exercise would provide an ideal base for the rehabilitation
efforts. This exercise is best carried out through multi-disciplinary teams which go into all aspects
of damage (social, economical, psychological) in participation with the local community. Based
on the assessment of the damage and the needs, a recovery strategy has to be formulated. The
strategy should include all interventions - economic, social, political and psychological. The
resources should be identified and the roles and responsibilities of all concerned should be
defined.

6.5 Co-ordination
6.5.1 Following any major disaster, a number of players arrive on the scene and as already
stated, ensuring proper coordination amongst them thus becomes very important. Recovery
activities are taken up by government agencies, local bodies, international agencies, voluntary
organisations and others, through separate, overlapping and uncoordinated interventions.
This leads to imbalances in the scale of operations, duplication of efforts in some areas, gaps in
others and leakage and misuse of resources. Therefore establishing a framework for coordination
is necessary for effective recovery. The role of voluntary organisations including international
ones like the Red Cross is extremely useful for mitigating the impact of disaster.
6.5.2 The administration is also required to set up a voluntary organisations’ coordination centre
to coordinate the relief and rehabilitation activities of the multiple organisations so that they are
not concentrated in a few pockets. It is often observed that post-disaster recovery efforts tend to
focus on rapid and visible solutions to restore normalcy at the cost of sustainable development.
The post-disaster recovery phase provides a ‘window of opportunity’ for disaster risk reduction.
Risk reduction aspects should therefore be built into the redevelopment process.

6.6 Shelter
Shelter is one of the most visible and immediate needs in post-crisis settings. Relief efforts are
often focused on providing shelter quickly, without taking into account the impact of shortterm shelter strategies. Long-term shelter strategies help not only to focus on determination and
implementation of realistic and permanent reconstruction plans for the affected communities,
but are also concerned with rebuilding community confidence and support structure for civic
responsibility and urban governance, through participatory planning of reconstruction. The
development of disaster resistant housing is a major factor in reducing vulnerability to disasters.
However, shelter issues in mitigation go beyond the structural aspects. Rights to ownership
and security of tenure make an enormous difference to the maintenance, management and
development of shelter, particularly in urban areas.

6.7 Sustainability in Recovery Process
Normally, it is seen that the recovery efforts have a tendency of tapering off with the passage
of time. The Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery of the UNDP has also observed “the
general experience is that once the initial flurry of activities of providing rescue and relief is
over, the attention received by the recovery efforts goes on declining steadily over a period of
time and ‘business as usual’ sets in”. The sustainability component in recovery process therefore
is important. This could be achieved by capability building of the community and awareness
generation and preparing local crisis management plans.

126

Recovery Reconstruction and Rehabilitation

6.8 Accountability
A system of accountability needs to be evolved during the relief and rehabilitation phase. This
system should ensure that the relief material reaches the target groups and that the funds are being
utilised efficiently and optimally. A grievance redressal mechanism should also be put in place.

6.9 Evaluation
After the recovery phase, it is necessary to conduct a detailed evaluation of all aspects of crisis
management. This should bring out the strengths and weaknesses of the disaster management
machinery and also provide the basis for future improvements. Such an evaluation should be
carried out by an independent professional agency like the NIDM, in all major disasters. This
assessment should also include a quick audit of the expenditure incurred.

6.10 Guidance Notes on Recovery
The International Recovery Platform (IRP) and United Nations Development Programme India
have developed Guidance Notes on Recovery on nine sectors namely Shelter, Infrastructure,
Gender, Livelihood, Environment, Governance, Climate Change, Health and Psycho-social
support. These are initial steps in documenting, collecting and sharing disaster recovery
experiences and lessons. This collection of the successes and failures of past experiences in
disaster recovery is expected to help in the planning and implementation of future recovery
initiatives. The aim of the guidance notes is not to recommend actions, but to place before the
personnel involved in the risk-reducing recovery process a menu of options. The sector specific
Guidance Notes are primarily intended for use by policymakers, planners, and implementers
of local, regional and national government bodies interested or engaged in facilitating a more
responsive, sustainable, and risk reducing recovery process. Since the governments are not the
sole actors in disaster recovery and IRP believes that the experiences collected in this document
can benefit many other partners working together to build back better. These Guidance Notes
on different sectors are available on their website www.recoveryplatform.org.

6.11 Some Indian Experiences in Recovery in the Last Two Decades
Few experiences of post disaster recovery rehabilitation and reconstruction works are illustrated
in the subsequent paras. This shows the experiences which country as a whole has gathered
in course of its recovery process after the event of different kind of disasters whether human
induced or natural. This may guide the responders in the future such endeavors and may also
help them to take corrective measures.

6.12 Bhopal Gas Tragedy (1984)
6.12.1 The Bhopal Gas Tragedy is one of the world’s worst industrial catastrophes. It occurred
on the night of 2-3 December, 1984 at the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) Pesticide plant
in Bhopal which was the Indian subsidiary of Union Carbide Corporation, USA. The accident
occurred due to leakage of Methyl Iso Cynate (MIC) and other chemicals due to ingression
of water and the resulting reaction affected a large number of persons. Approximately 2000
people are known to have died in the first 72 hours and large proportion of the survivors suffered
acute multi-system morbidities (eyes and lungs were the target organs). The ICMR estimated that
approximately 62.58% of the total population in Bhopal suffered from inhalational toxicity. The
people who resided in areas close to the carbide factory were exposed to higher concentration
of potentially lethal toxic gases.

6.12.2 A large proportion of population who survived this tragedy developed morbidity of
varying degree over the last 25 years. As an immediate response, the state government of
Madhya Pradesh provided financial support to the affected families and an amount of `.12.80
crore was distributed as immediate relief. Food items were also distributed to the affected
population and compensation was paid for livestock loss. An amount of ` 3.78 crore was spent to
provide compensation to the families of a deceased.
6.12.3 During 1990 in the first five year action plan a sum of ` 258 Crore was sanctioned by the
Central government and it got extended till 1999. This plan provided ` 150.35 crore for medical
rehabilitation in addition to economic rehabilitation (` 21.18 crore), social rehabilitation (` 49.72
crore) and environmental rehabilitation (` 23.76 crore). The present action plan for Rehabilitation
of Government of Madhya Pradesh is given in Table: 6.1 includes the following features:

for Economic, Social, Medical and Environmental rehabilitation of victim of Bhopal Gas Tragedy.
Central Government has sanctioned ` 272.75 crore to Madhya Pradesh Government.

6.13 Kutch Earthquake (2001)
The Kutch earthquake of 26th January, 2001 was one of the worst natural disasters to strike in
Gujarat. It posed enormous challenges because of its magnitude, intensity and geographical
spread for rescue, relief and rehabilitation.
6.13.1 The devastation –a glimpse: Overall 7633 villages in 21 out of 25 districts of Gujarat were
affected to varying degrees. The districts most affected were Kutch, Surendaranagar, Jamnagar,
Rajkot, Patan and Ahmedabad. Almost 13, 805 human lives were lost, about 1,67,000 persons

Kutch earthquake 2001 and reconstruction of house

were injured and over a million houses were damaged and destroyed. About 10,000 small and
medium industrial units went out of production, affecting income and employment. Inspite
of the immediate sense of shock, confusion, helplessness and grief, the government and the
community rose to the occasion and quickly responded to the event. Soon after, a holistic
and comprehensive reconstruction and rehabilitation programme was put in place. A new
organization, the Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority was established. The Government
of Gujarat also announced the Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Policy (2001).
6.13.2 The Gujarat Earthquake Reconstruction Programme was designed to address the needs
of the affected people comprehensively. It adopted a building back better approach, involved
the community and encompassed a number of sectors such as housing physical infrastructure,
social infrastructure (education and health), urban reconstruction, livelihood restoration, social
rehabilitation and long term disaster risk reduction.
6.13.3 The reconstruction programme had the following objectives:
(i) Promoting sustainable recovery in disaster affected areas, and
(ii) Laying the foundation for sustainable disaster management capacity in Gujarat.
The phase-wise focus of the programme is summarised as follows:
(a) The short term focus of the reconstruction programme was to address the immediate needs
such as temporary shelters before the onset of the monsoon, debris removal, repair of
houses and public buildings and emergency repair of irrigation structures.

130

Recovery Reconstruction and Rehabilitation
(b) The medium term objectives of the programme emphasised the repair and reconstruction of
houses, public infrastructure, and social infrastructure and initiating efforts towards disaster
mitigation and reduction.
(c) The long term objective of the reconstruction programme was further strengthening
the capacity of government institutions and community towards disaster risk reduction
(preparedness, response, mitigation and prevention) and implementation of risk transfer
mechanism.
6.13.4 Some of the salient features of the Gujarat Reconstruction Programme are as follows:
(i) Owner Driven Reconstruction: The reconstruction of the houses was done by the owners
themselves with technical assistance provided by the government. This involved minimum
relocation and out of 215,255 houses that were reconstructed only 5720 houses were
partially relocated. To provide technical guidance to the community and ensure that the
newly built houses were hazard resistant, large number of engineers, architects and masons
were trained and technical guidelines were developed. A third party audit mechanism was
established to control quality.
(ii) Housing Insurance: The Housing Insurance Programme was incorporated as a compulsory
component for all G-5 houses and optional for houses of other categories. The insurance
covered 14 types of risks for 10 years and the premium was fixed at ` 349.10 for an insured
sum of `1 lakh.
(iii) Urban reconstruction of all the four towns in Kutch ensured planning principles with
improvement of basic services and urban environment.
(iv) A regulatory system for safe construction was strengthened and licensing of engineers and
certification of masons were introduced.
(v) Mass awareness on disaster preparedness was undertaken to prepare the community to
face similar future eventualities.

6.14 Tsunami (2004)
6.14.1 The Dec 26th 2004 Indian ocean tsunami caused extensive damage to the infrastructure
including harbours, jetties, roads, bridges, power, telecom, hospitals, schools and other
social sector buildings besides human loss of 9395 persons and 3,964 were missing after the
disaster. The estimated loss in monetary terms including damage to property was reported
at ` 11544.91 crore (Andhra Pradesh- ` 342.67 crore, Kerala- ` 2371.02 crore, Tamil Nadu- `
4528.66 crore, Andman & Nicobar Islands ` 3836.56 and Puducherry – ` 466.00 crore). In terms
of housing, 86,688 houses were damaged, with 53,192 vulnerable to damage. Approximately
12000 hectares of agricultural land was damaged and 3000 hectares of land was rendered
unusable due to salinity in the soil. A total 47 Fishing Landing Centres (FLC) got damaged and
approximately 28000 boats were damaged. The loss assessed by respective state government
may be seen at Table 6.2.

in these camps. About 12,735 tents were dispatched to the affected areas – mostly to A&N
Islands. 64 special flights were operated between 27th Dec 2004 – 1st Jan 2005 to evacuate
6,318 stranded people including tourists in A&N Islands. In all 28,734 persons were rescued
– 9950 in Kerala, 9284 in A&N Islands, and 9500 in TN including 1000 persons stranded at
Vivekanand Memorial. 6.45 lakhs persons – Main Land (6.30 lakhs) and A&N Islands (0.15
lakhs) were moved to safer places.
(ii) Financial Measures: Government of India made immediate release of ` 700 crore for the
Tsunami affected States and UTs. An amount of ` 450 crore was released as an immediate
assistance from the National Calamity Contingency Fund (NCCF) to the States of Tamil
Nadu (` 250 crore), Kerala (` 100 crore) and Andhra Pradesh (` 100 crore). In addition, an
amount of ` 50 crore to Puducherry and ` 200 crore for Andaman & Nicobar Islands was
also earmarked.

Out of the total outlay of ` 3644.05 crore under RGRP some of the components like Housing,
Livelihood & Fisheries etc. worth of ` 1776.62 crore were subsequently merged in the “Tsunami
Rehabilitation Programme” (TRP).
6.14.3 Long-Term Tsunami Reconstruction Programme (TRP): After the completion of rescue
and relief phase, the Government of India approved TRP at an estimated cost of ` 9870.25
crore which was to be implemented during 2005-06 to 2008-09. The GoI approved the revised
TRP package, at an estimated cost of ` 9822.10 crore on 10.1.2007 comprising the following
components:(i) ` 1776.62 crore under the Rajiv Gandhi Package.
(ii) ` 3332.43 crore through External Agencies viz World Bank, ADB and IFAD.
(iii) ` 4713.05 crore as Domestic Budgetary Support.
Table 6.4 shows that status of rehabilitation measures taken up under TRP. The TRP includes
reconstruction activities in five major sectors such as housing fisheries, agriculture and livelihoods,
ports and jetties and roads and bridges, in addition to power, water and sewerage, social infrastructure
and welfare, environmental and coastal protection and tourism. The prime objective of the Tsunami
Rehabilitation Programme is to reconstruct damaged infrastructure with value addition and restore
livelihood of the people. An amount of ` 4171.98 crore had been allocated for housing underTRP which
is about 42.5% of the total outlay. The GoI while reviewing the progress of TRP on 11.2.2010 has further
modified the outlay to ` 9381.96 crore (` 6049.54 crore under ACA and ` 3332.42 crore under EAP).
This includes an additional requirement of ` 108 crore for Puducherry and ` 138.30 crore for A&NI.
6.14.4. Status: The physical works are likely to be completed by December, 2011
except tourism works of Andaman & Nicobar Islands which is stated to be completed
by March, 2012.

6.15 Kosi Calamity (2008)
6.15.1 The Kosi (known as “Kaushiki” in Sanskrit) is one of the most ancient rivers of India. The river
is notorious for its vagaries and known to change its bed very often. During the last two centuries,
the river has been changing its course in the westerly directions and it has laterally moved nearly
70 miles. On 18.08.2008 the Kosi river started eroding the spurs on the eastern efflux bundh 12
km. up stream of the Birpur barrage in Supaul district and breached the embankment. After the
breach, the entire river spilled out and started flowing along a new course running straight down
south. The course of the river was approximately 15 to 20 km wide and 150 km long north to south.
The entire country side within this 3000 sq. kms. was totally devastated by the rapid surging flow
of the river along its new course. Houses, schools, roads, dispensaries were all flooded and swept
away. A total of 35 blocks, 407 panchayats and 980 villages in five districts with a total population
of 33, 89, 000 fell along the new course of the river. Totally, 217 people and 868 cattle were killed
and 3,38,986 houses were partly or fully damaged due to the catastrophe.
6.15.2 Immediate Response: The affected areas had never experienced such a catastrophe
and had not seen floods for the last 50 years, therefore they had inadequate arrangements to
face the situation. The state administration deployed 1500 boats locally in addition to the 561
motor boats mobilised from NDRF, army, navy and other sources. About 12 helicopters carried
out 314 sorties and air dropped about 1, 21, 892 packets of food, water and halogen tablets
besides distribution of about 2, 39, 858 food packets by boats to the people in the affected
areas. The state government carried out one of the largest evacuation operations of about 9, 93,
992 persons ever organised in the country. About 5000 civilian personnel, 3500 police men, 35

columns of army, 4 columns of the navy, 850 personnel of NDRF, 1500 boats and 560 motor boats
were deployed for the evacuation.
6.15.3 Mega Shelter Camps: The State Government set up 362 relief camps in the buildings of
schools and colleges. At the peak of the disaster 4, 40,739 people were living in the camps. Self
help groups were constituted to look after the preparation and distribution of meals. A special
thrust was on women and newly born babies; clothes and utensils were given to each camp
inmate as relief measures. Other features of the shelter are outlined below:
• A total of 3,750 temporary toilets
constructed, 2,155 hand pumps installed
in the camps, generators and solar lamps
provided for lighting in the camps,
• Schools set up for the children in the camp
and 56,304 children enrolled in these schools,
• Anganwadi Centres set up in each major
camp,
• Skill development programmes initiated
and training provided to willing persons in
handicrafts and cottage industries,

• Health sub-centres set up in each camp with
doctors on duty round the clock with provision for free medicines and camps were also covered
by a mobile team. A total of 491 doctors and 1578 paramedical staff deployed on a daily basis.
Maternity huts set up in relief camps and 183 deliveries reported in these maternity centres,
• A total of 108 ambulances were deployed.

6.15.4 Livestock: To cater to the affected livestock, 257 veterinary centres manned by 387
personnel were set up. As per the report 47,430 animals were kept in camps and 321630 animals
were vaccinated.
Box 6. 2: Kosi Flood Reconstruction And Rehabilitation Programme
Background: The state government has formulated Kosi Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project
with the purpose of reconstructing the houses, providing community facilities, complete restoration of
physical infrastructure, livelihood support based on the policy of sustained economy and environment etc
for the people affected by the calamity. The project is based on the success of the pilot Kosi Recovery and
Reconstruction project supported by the UNDP in two villages through the Owner Driven Reconstruction
Collaborative network of civil society organisations.
Components: The World Bank aided project Kosi Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project has the
following major components:
(i)

Owner Driven Housing Reconstruction - Using an owner driven reconstruction model, about
1000,000 houses will be built with a brick and concrete plinth, bamboo superstructure and
corrugated galvanized iron (CGI) sheeting roof. The cost per house will be ` 55,000 with a currently
estimated cost of ` 2,300 for a toilet and ` 5,000) for solar powered lighting.

(ii)

Reconstruction of Roads and Bridges – Under this component, connectivity lost due to the
Kosi flood would be restored by reconstruction of damaged roads and bridges/culverts, including
construction of some new bridges. The project is expected to construct about 90 bridges and culverts
on the State Highway and Major District Roads and reconstruct about 290 km of rural roads, which
would benefit around 2.2 million people. New cross drainage structures will be provided where new
streams have formed and where these were missing earlier.

(iii) Strengthening Flood Management Capacity - This component would strengthen the overall
flood forecasting and flood and sediment management capacity in Bihar by enhancing knowledge,
understanding, and capacity of flood and sediment management. This will be achieved by
implementing both structural and non-structural measures, mainly focusing on the Kosi River Basin.
The component has three subcomponents:
a.

Knowledge management and capacity building;

b.

Flood forecasting and early warning; and

c.

Structural investments.

(iv) Livelihood Restoration and Enhancement – The component is to build social and financial
capital and expand the livelihood opportunities of the affected people of Madhepura, Supaul and
Saharsa. This component will have four subcomponents: (i) Community Institution Development; (ii)
Community Investment Fund; (iii) Technical Assistance Fund; and (iv) Project Management.
(v) Improving Emergency Response Capacity – This component aims at making contingency
funding available for civil works, consultant services and goods required to respond in case of future
emergencies.
(vi) Project Management and Implementation Support –This component is to support project
implementation through the provision of necessary offices including equipment.
Finance: Total Cost of the World bank aided project formulated by the Government is $220 million about
` 1,000 crores.

6.16 Leh Cloudburst (2010)
6.16.1 A rare phenomenon, a rainfall of 12.8mm during the intervening night of 5/6th August
2010 coupled with cloud burst resulted in flash floods and mud slides causing havoc and large
scale loss of life and public infrastructure/private property particularly in Leh region. Besides the

local population large numbers of tourists both Indian and foreign nationals, as well as labourers
from outside the region who had gone there for earning a livelihood got trapped to face the
most tragic and difficult circumstances.
		
6.16.2 Response: More than 6000 personnel of Army, Air Force, Border Roads Organization,
National Disaster Response Force and Indo Tibetan Border Police were deployed along with rescue
equipment to assist the civil administration in relief operations. Large quantities of relief material

such as tents, blankets, tarpaulins, mattresses, food packets and bottled water were provided.
Contributions from the charitable organisations and other sources were also sent. Apart from
the medical teams available with army, CPMFs, state, etc. one medical team consisting of 08
Doctors and 04 Nurses along with 10 quintals of emergent surgical/medical consumables were
deployed in the affected area from Delhi. Additional medical supplies and medical equipments
were sent to the affected areas. A total of 55 civil aircrafts were operated and more than 8000
people were evacuated. The Air Force also carried out 226 sorties and airlifted 302 tonnes of relief
material and equipments and 818 persons. Funds to the tune of ` 429.24 crore ($ 95 million)
were available with the state government in their State Disaster Response Fund for undertaking
immediate relief activities. The Prime Minister announced a rehabilitation package of ` 125 crore
($ 30 million).
6.16.3 Lesson learnt: The gap in the response to the remote hilly area and the disaster being
of unprecedented requires strengthening of the National Emergent Reserve and placing it at
similar vulnerable areas for prompt relief. Besides there is an urgent need to strengthen the
communication system i.e. multi modal system and create an awareness among people about
the cloud burst and its consequences.

6.17 Mayapuri Radiation Exposure Delhi (2010)
6.17.1 The National Radiation Regulatory Authority, Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB)
received a message in the afternoon of 7th April, 2010 from Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, New
Delhi that one person, aged 32 years, the owner of a scrap shop in Mayapuri Industrial Area, New
Delhi had been admitted on 4th April, 2010 with symptoms of radiation exposure.
Box 6.3: Recovery an Opportunity
Disaster can become a development opportunity if relief efforts do not merely restore the poor status quo
ante, but rather put people on a path of sustainable development. The goal in the transition phase must
be to avoid a ‘circularity of risk’. This is what can happen when houses built with valuable international
assistance get washed away during floods, dams left unrepaired after an earthquake aggravate drought
conditions, and procedural delays in receiving rehabilitation packages from government and donor
agencies leave the poor more vulnerable to the next disaster.
(Source: From Relief to Recovery: The Gujarat Experience: UNDP)

6.17.2 The Team of Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) visited the place immediately with
radiation detection equipments and monitored the radiation levels at various positions near the
scrap shop. They found that the particular shop as well as a couple of nearby shops had very high
radiation fields. Next day, teams of Radiation Safety Experts from BARC, AERB & Narora Atomic
Power Station were sent to Delhi with a wide range of radiation monitoring, detecting equipments
and a lead flask to locate, identify, recover, safely secure and dispose radioactive sources.
6.17.3 The response team identified the radiation source as Cobalt-60, used mainly in industry
for radiography and in teletherapy for cancer treatment. During the search operation, the team
could locate, recover and secure eight sources of different intensities. These sources were placed
in the lead shielded flask brought from Narora and sent for further examination and safe disposal.
Subsequently the area was cleared for the public. A radiation survey of scrap metal shops in
neighboring areas was carried out following the incident. It indicated elevated radiation levels
in one more scrap shop about 500 m away from the ones where radiation sources were found

140

Recovery Reconstruction and Rehabilitation
earlier. A joint team consisting of AERB and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) recovered
two more radioactive sources from this shop. Both the sources were safely transferred to a
shielding flask and transported back to Narora.
6.17.4 As a follow up to this incident, four joint teams of BARC, AERB and NDRF were formed and
the surroundings of all remaining 800 shops in the market were scanned when the shops were
closed on 14th April, 2010. The entire area was found to be free of elevated radiation fields except
at the entrance of the market where the soil over a small patch was slightly contaminated. The
contaminated soil showed Cobalt-60 contamination but of very low order. Subsequently, the
contaminated soil up to a depth of few centimetres was removed to bring down the radiation
field.
6.17.5 Constitution of a Working Group: In the backdrop of the discovery of radiation sources
from the scrap in Mayapuri in New Delhi and also to minimise the possibility of such recurrences
in future, NDMA constituted a working group headed by Shri B. Bhattacharjee, Member, NDMA
to spell out the roles and responsibilities of various agencies in dealing with Radiological
Emergencies. The committee has submitted its report with the title “Working Group for
Formulating mechanisms to detect, prevent and respond to radiological emergencies in India”
to the Cabinet Secretariat. Further follow up on the recommendations of the committee is being
done by the Cabinet Secretariat and NDMA.

6.18 Conclusion
Recovery, early recovery, long-term recovery, lasting recovery, reconstruction and rehabilitation
are critical phases of Disaster Management Cycle. They offer an opportunity to reduce risks from
future hazards and the ‘Build back better’ approach followed in the recovery programmes after
major recent disasters give us valuable lessons on how to approach this phase. It is anticipated
that the experiences mentioned would help the stakeholders in planning effective, efficient and
time bound action plan in the event of disasters.

Disaster Management in India

Capacity
Development

142

7.1 An Overview
Effective disaster management requires trained manpower to deal with complex situations
effectively and speedily to reduce the impact of disaster on human life and property. It is necessary
to continuously undertake measures to build capacity amongst those who are handling disaster
prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response, reconstruction and also creating awareness
amongst people. Therefore, capacity building needs to encompass all resources available within
a community, society and organisation to reduce the level of risk or the effects of a disaster.

7.2 Definition
UNDP describes ‘capacity building’ as the creation of an enabling environment with appropriate
policy and legal frameworks, institutional development, including community participation (of
women in particular), human resource development and strengthening of managerial systems.
It adds that capacity building is a long-term, continuing process, in which all stakeholders
participate (ministries, local authorities, non-governmental organisations and water user
association’s professional associations, academics and others). Capacity may include physical,
institutional, social or economic means as well as skilled personal or collective attributes such as
leadership and management. Capacity may also be described as capability.
7.2.1 Capacity building31 is much more than training and includes the following:
•

Human resource development, the process of equipping individuals with the understanding,
skills and access to information, knowledge and training that enables them to perform
effectively,

•

Organisational development, the elaboration of management structures, processes and
procedures, not only within organisations but also the management of relationships
between the different organisations and sectors (public, private and community),

•

Institutional and legal framework development, making legal and regulatory changes to
enable organisations, institutions and agencies at all levels and in all sectors to enhance
their capacities.

7.2.2 Following are considered as vital components of the capacity development:
(i) Training: It is a learning process that involves the acquisition of knowledge, sharpening of
skills, concepts, rules, or change of attitude and behavior to enhance the performance of
individuals associated with different departments and institutions.
(ii) Education: Amidst changes of the past decades, school education sector, the most discussed
topic of national importance, is planning for more contextual, practical and application
oriented curriculum for students at different levels of schooling.
(iii) Research: Research is an organised and systematic way of finding answers to questions.
Systematic because there are certain things in the research process which are always done
in order to get most accurate result.
(iv) Awareness: Awareness is generally defined as knowledge created through interaction
between an agent and its environment. It cannot be simply referred to as “knowing what
is going on.” This concept of awareness involves state of knowledge as well as dynamic
processes of perception and action.

143

Disaster Management in India

7.3 Approach
7.3.1 The National Policy on Disaster Management (NPDM) describes its approach to capacity
development. A strategic approach to capacity development can be addressed effectively
only with the active and enthusiastic participation of the stakeholders. This process comprises
of awareness generation, education, training, research and development (R&D) etc. It further
addresses to put in place an appropriate institutional framework, management systems and
allocation of resources for efficient prevention and handling of disasters. The approach to
capacity development includes• According priority to training for developing community based DM systems for their specific
needs in view of the regional diversities and multi-hazard vulnerabilities,
• Conceptualisation of community based DM systems at the national level through a consultative
process involving the States and other stakeholders with the state and local level authorities
in charge of implementation,
• Identification of knowledge-based institutions with proven performance,  
• Promotion of International and Regional cooperation,
• Adoption of traditional and global best practices and technologies,
• Laying emphasis on table-top exercises, simulations, mock drills and development of skills to
test the plans,
• Capacity analysis of different disaster responder groups at State, District, and local levels.
7.3.2 NPDM has further elaborated on national priorities, institutional capacity development,
training of communities, professional technical education, DM education in schools, training
of artisans, training of other groups and licensing and certification. Besides NPDM guidelines
issued by NDMA also lay emphasis on capacity development.
7.3.3 Capacity development in India: A realistic National Capacity Development Programme,
commensurate with the intensity and extent of the hazard in India needs to be evolved and
implemented, keeping in view the available resources. This programme of resource enhancement
should encompass all institutions,organizations and individuals that have a role in any part of
the disaster management cycle.
7.3.4 Capacity gaps in disaster management : To mitigate the impact of disasters, there is a
need to work collectively through multidimensional channels combining the efforts, resources
and expertise of the government, non- governmental organisations and civil societies. Managing
such incidents holistically is a highly specialised and skilled job which cannot be approached in
an ad hoc manner. Disaster Management comprises of multi sectoral issues and accordingly calls
for all sectors that play pivotal role in managing exigencies to develop their human resource
capacity accordingly. There seems to exist a wide gap in the knowledge, skill, and attitude of
the disaster managers for efficiently managing emergency situations particularly at local and
state level where according to one study made by NIDM, Capacity-Risk ratio is remarkably low.
To bridge this gap, it is important to have specific capacity development plans and strategies.
7.3.5 Target group: In the field of capacity development, priority is to be given to training of
DM officials, functionaries, trainers and elected representatives and community representatives.
Due importance requires to be given to DM training and orientation of professionals like doctors,
engineers and architects apart from those engaged in response and relief. DM training further

144

Capacity Development
requires to be included in curricula of educational institutions at all levels of schooling and
should include practical instructions as well.
7.3.6 Realizing the importance of Capacity Development of stakeholders in Disaster Management,
NIDM has been given the task of preparing National Human Resource and Capacity Development
plan, which is at the advanced stage of its formulation. The first draft has been prepared and
presented before the MHA. NIDM is finalizing the plan after holding the discussion with MHA on
its first draft.
Institutions for Capacity Development

7.4 National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM)
7.4.1 Background: In the backdrop of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction
(IDNDR), a National Centre for Disaster Management was established at IIPA in 1995. The Centre
was upgraded and designated as the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) on 16th
October 2003 and it has now achieved the status of a statutory organisation under the National
Disaster Management Act, 2005. Section 42 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 entrusts the
institute with various responsibilities, namely to develop training modules, undertake research
and documentation in disaster management, organise training programmes, undertake and
organise study courses, conferences, lectures and seminars to promote and institutionalise
disaster management, undertake and provide for publication of journals, research papers and
books. Located centrally at the Indraprastha Estate on the Mahatma Gandhi Road, within the
campus of the IIPA, the institute is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities of training and
research on disaster management. It has training and conference halls, well stocked library,
GIS laboratory, computer centre, and video conferencing facility. The institute also provides
boarding and lodging facilities for participants during its programmes.
7.4.2 Training Programmes of NIDM: The different formats in which training is imparted by
NIDM include:
(i) Face-to-face training: NIDM conducts both in campus and off-campus training programmes.
In-campus programmes are conducted in the premises of the Institute while the off-campus
programmes are conducted mostly in state capitals, at the premises of the Administrative
Training Institutes. It conducts as many as 92 training programmes on diversified themes
of disaster management, with many new programmes added continually. The participants
of these programmes are usually middle and senior level government officers nominated
by the state governments and concerned ministries and departments of the Government
of India. The programmes constitute class room lectures and presentations, field visits,
group exercises, panel discussions etc. It does not charge any course fees. Boarding and
lodging arrangements are also made free of charge. During the year 2010-11, the institute
has conducted 84 training programmes, which have been attended by 2142 participants.
(ii) Web- based training: In collaboration with World Bank Institute, Washington, the Institute
conducts on-line training programmes on basic and specialised subjects on disaster
management. The courses are open to all interested persons with a token charge of ` 1500
for the basic course of one and half months and ` 1000 for specialised courses of one month
duration to cover the cost of reading materials, postage etc. Every participant is expected
to take part in on-line discussions. The successful candidates are awarded certificates

145

Disaster Management in India
signed jointly by the NIDM and WBI. In 2010-11, three online training programmes
on Comprehensive Disaster Risk Management Framework and four specialised online
programmes on Community Based Disaster Risk Management, Climate Change and Disaster
Management, Risk Sensitive Land Use Planning and Safe Cities have been organized. A total
of over 438 participants attended these online courses. The Institute has also started the
process of customisation of eight modules to Indian context.
(iii) Satellite based training: The Institute has collaborated with Administrative Training
Institutes, Bhopal and Mysore to conduct satellite based training programmes through
the ISRO community centres that have satellite based one-way video and two-way audio
communication system. More than hundred centres join the programme simultaneously in
which thousands of grassroots level functionaries take part. The Institute is extending the
programmes in number of other states where similar facilities have been seen set up.
(iv) Self study courses: The Institute is in the process of launching web based training courses
on various themes such as basics of disaster management, earthquake, flood, cyclone,
disaster management for civil defence volunteers, public health workers, school children
and community preparedness, which anyone from anywhere at any time can log on. The
aim of such courses is to create interest and raise the level of awareness of people regarding
disaster management and in some cases supplement the existing class room based training
programmes.
(v) India Disaster Management Congress: NIDM has taken the lead in organizing the India
Disaster Management Congress (IDMC) on the pattern of India Science Congress to bring
together scientists, scholars and practitioners from diverse disciplines on the same platform.
The first such Congress was held in November 2006 which was inaugurated by Hon’ble Prime
Minister of India. The Institute organized the Second India Disaster Management Congress
in November 2009. The congress had twenty six thematic sessions around twelve different
thematic clusters where over 300 technical papers were presented. Hon’ble Shri APJ Abdul
Kalam, Former President of India graced the occasion and delivered the valedictory address.
(vi) Capacity Building Programme for Engineers and Architects in Earthquake Risk
Management: Ministry of Home Affairs initiated this twin programmes for capacity building
of engineers (National Programme for Capacity Building of Engineers in Earthquake Risk
Management) and architects (National Programme for Capacity Building of Architects
in Earthquake Risk Management) at the cost of `12.36 and .`4.51 crore respectively in
earthquake risk management. The programme which started in 2004-05 was implemented
till 2008 by the MHA and has subsequently been transferred to the NIDM for implementation
with effect from 01.4.2008.

7.5 National Disaster Management Authority
7.5.1 NDMA undertakes several initiatives in the process of capacity development. Few of them
are illustrated as follows:
7.5.2 Mock Exercises: NDMA undertakes mock exercises in vulnerable districts and industries
on various types of natural and man-made disasters to help the state governments and
district administration in reviewing the adequacy and efficacy of the state and district level
Disaster Management Plans and to identify gaps in resources and systems. So far NDMA has

146

Capacity Development
conducted nearly 211 mock exercises including 90 similar exercises in schools. During the
Commonwealth Games, similar exercises were under taken through coordinated conferences,
table top exercises and the mock exercises on both natural and man-made disasters at
different competition and practice venues and at accommodation areas of players and
accompanying officials. Altogether, 55 such exercises were conducted at different venues of
the Commonwealth Games including the Games Village.
7.5.3 Mock Exercises on School Safety: Mock exercises in schools are conducted to empower
the schools to face the disasters squarely before the specialist response is affected. Details are
given in the Table 7.1.

Efforts of other Ministries in Capacity Development Programme on DM:

7.11 Ministry of Human Resource Development:
7.11.1 As an effort to mainstream disaster management concerns into the education curricula,
NDMA has taken the initiative in conjunction with the Ministry of Human Resource Development,
to ensure that DM curriculum forms part of the course curriculum in undergraduate science and
humanities courses and medical, engineering, architecture courses besides in school education.
It will also focus on the training of teachers and faculties in disaster management. Sarva
Siksha Abhiyaan (SSA) will also include the concerns of disaster resilience in their adult literacy
curriculum.
7.11.2 The topics on Disaster Management aim to:
i.

Acquaint students about various disasters that India is vulnerable to and the hazard maps to
enable them to visualize these vulnerabilities,

ii.

Introduce a few key concepts in disaster management in simple terms, to orient them to the
words used in media discussions, analysis etc. when a disaster strikes,

iii. Introduce the concept of being prepared for disaster through simple do-s and don’ts that
school children can imbibe and spread to families and community,
iv. Develop interest in the subject through interactive activities in the classroom so that the
student seeks more information on disaster.
7.11.3 Syllabus of different classes from VIIIth to XIth The Central Board of Secondary Education
has taken the initiative of including disaster management topics as frontline curriculum in the
subject of social science with effect from 2003-2004 in class VIIIth and extended it to class IXth and
Xth in subsequent years. It was extended to class XI in 2005-2006 in the subjects of sociology and
geography.
DM syllabus are being introduced in universities. Pune ,Madras, IGNOU, and Indraprastha and
many other Universities has already started such courses and it is in the process of getting

7.11.4 NDMA has undertaken to get such courses introduced in undergraduate course. A module
has been provided to UGC similarly for introducing such courses in technical institutes. Modules
have been provided to AICTE in course of Engineering and architect. ICAR has introduced a DM
module for its courses in Agriculture and Vetenary
7.11.5 Organisation of training programme: With the financial and technical support from
Ministry of Home Affairs and the UNDP under the GOI_UNDP DRM programme (2002-2009), the
Central Board of Secondary Education was able to successfully complete two master trainers
programmes across the country during the year 2003-2006.These training programme helped
the teachers to successfully transect the subject in the class room. Demonstrations were carried
out on first aid, search and rescue, evacuation etc by the health department, fire services etc. An
impact study on disaster management textbooks was conducted by CBSE in July, 2006 with the
purpose of updating the textual material by incorporating recent developments and obtaining
feedback from the teacher and students.,. Feedback questionnaires were sent to 180 schools
all over the country. The information received from schools was analyzed with the purpose of
reviewing and updating the existing text books.

7.12 Ministry of Panchayati Raj & Rural Development
NDMA has advised the Ministry of Panchayati Raj and Rural Development to address the concerns
of disaster management in the training of representatives of the Panchayati Raj Institutions and
local bodies. The Ministry of Panchayati Raj has also issued a letter N-11012/35/2007-P&J Vol III

160

Capacity Development
dated 1.9.2010 in this regard. Accordingly, all the ongoing and future projects of this ministry
should incorporate disaster resilient features into them. States efforts’ towards training of
Panchayati Raj functionaries and district level officials has been initiated in 11 states in association
with IGNOU. Altogether 4,125 government functionaries and 12,375 PRI/ ULB representatives are
targeted to be trained in disaster management under this project.

7.13 Conclusions
7.13.1 Disaster management requires trained human resources to deal with complex situation
effectively to mitigate the impact of disaster on human life and property. Capacity Development
is an integral process of knowledge and skill building. Capacity may include physical, institutional,
social or economic means as well as skilled personal or collective attributes such as leadership
and management. Capacity Development is much more then training and it includes human
resource development, equipping individual with understanding, skills and access to information,
knowledge and training that enables him to perform effectively.
7.13.2 National Policy on Disaster Management (NPDM) describes its approach to capacity
development. NPDM further elaborates on National priorities, institutional capacity
development, training communities, professional technical education, DM education in school,
training to artisan and training to other group. Capacity development has focused on training of
the DM officials, functionaries, trainers, elected representatives and community representatives.
Various institutions like, NDMA, NIDM, NCDC, NFSC and ministries have developed the capacity
development programme for disaster management.
7.13.3 The details included in this chapter are only illustrative and not exhaustive. Capacity
Development strategies are now being mainstreamed in most of the ministries and Government
department at National, State and District level to equip the DM personal and community with
advance knowledge and skill in disaster management. It is expected that once the National
Human Resource and Capacity Development Plan is adopted, it will help in mainstreaming the
capacity development in different activities of the ministries of Government of India concerned,
state government and other stakeholders.

8.3. National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF)
8.3.1 Section 46(1) of DM Act 2005 provides for constitution of NDRF for meeting any threatening
disaster management situation or disaster. Accordingly, DM Division issued notification for the
constitution of NDRF on 28th September 2010. The Finance Ministry has also issued guidelines to
the state for operation of NDRF.

164

Financial Arrangements
8.3.2 Sourcing of National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF): The Government of India raised
this Fund by levying the “National Calamity Contingency Duty” on imported petrol and products,
crude oil, motor cars, imported multi utility vehicles, two wheelers, mobile phones, pan masala
and certain specific tobacco products. The collection for year 2009-10 was ` 3160.00 crore and
was expected to be around ` 3900.00 crore in the financial year 2010-2011. For the year 2011-12,
the estimate is ` 4525.00 crores.
8.3.3 Additional Financial Assistance: Over and above the provisions of the SDRF, funding is
provided from the NDRF in the wake of calamities of severe nature. On receipt of the memorandum
from the affected states, an Inter Ministerial Central Team comprising of representatives of the
central ministries/ departments is constituted and its report after examination by the Inter
Ministerial Group (IMG) headed by Home Secretary is placed before the High Level Committee
(HLC) for their consideration and approval of funds from NDRF. The composition of HLC is given in
the Policy and Guideline, Chapter-2, which at present are headed by Finance Minister with Home
Minister, Minister for Agriculture and Vice Chairman of Planning Commission as its member on
the committee.

8.4 Monitoring of Expenditure from Relief Funds
The Ministry of Home Affairs oversees the operations of SDRF and monitors its compliance with
these guidelines. A format for monitoring the relief expenditure in accordance with the extant
items and norms of assistance has been prescribed. A web based computerized tracking system
has also been developed for monitoring the relief expenditure. The Accountant General of the
State maintains the accounts of the SDRF. The Comptroller & Auditor General of India audits
SDRF every year.

8.5 Disaster Response Reserve
In the context of disaster relief, the 13th Finance Commission has observed that procurement of
relief materials on short notice is often associated with premium in pricing and could adversely
impact quality. The Commission also felt that a national inventory of equipment and material
should be maintained for providing immediate relief. It is advisable to keep an inventory of items
such as life saving equipment and tents etc. with the NDRF. The Commission has accordingly
recommended an initial grant of `.250.00 crores in the form of a revolving fund to be provided
to the NDRF for this purpose. Whenever these items are used for responding to a calamity, the
cost (or rent for those items that can be reused) should be booked to the overall cost of relief
operations incurred by the state government and the inventory replenished on a regular basis.
A proposal to constitute this fund along with guidelines for its operations is under consideration
of the government.

8.6 Capacity Building Grant
On the recommendation of the 13th Finance Commission, ` 525.00 crore has been allocated to the
states for taking up activities for building capacity in the administrative machinery. The state wise
allocation for the period 2010-15 is given in Table No- 8.2. The Ministry of Finance has issued the
guidelines for the utilization of the fund. The guidelines provide for preparation of an action plan
for the entire period of 2010-15 as well as action plans for each financial year. These plans would
inter alia include items for training and capacity building of stakeholders and functionaries in
states, preparation of disaster management plans based on hazard, risk and vulnerability analysis
and setting up and strengthening of emergency operations centres in states.

care to ensure that there are established financial mechanisms available both at the state and
central level to address the resource requirements for such eventualities. The present scheme of
State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) are based on
the recommendation of 13th finance commission operated from 1st April 2010 to 31st March 2015.
For disasters needing central support over and above the SDRF, the processing of the request of
the state government for support from the Government of India is done by Ministry of Home
Affairs (DM Division) while the budgetary provisions for the relief funds is dealt with by the
Ministry of Finance. It is to be noted that the funds have also been allocated for strengthening
of Disaster Management Institutions, Capacity Development of stakeholder’s, prevention &
mitigation and the response mechanism. Efforts are also underway to ensure that the mitigation
and prevention of disaster are also given adequate importance by utilizing these funds so that
the impact of the disasters is minimized.

9.3 Agencies of United Nations involved in Disaster Management
There are various UN organizations engaged in the field of disaster management. Many of such
organisation have direct linkages with UN’s mainstream body, where as other’s are evolved and
are developed from the region of Asia, which have been most vulnerable to earthquake and
cyclone. India has been actively involved in their setting up besides being members on the basis
of its full time membership. A brief overview of such organizations has been presented in the
following paras:

176

International Cooperation

9.4 United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR)
9.4.1 At the end of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction in July 1999, the
International Programme Forum adopted the Geneva Mandate on Disaster Reduction, together
with the strategy document, “The Forum recommended that in international cooperative
framework for disaster reduction be maintained and strengthened.
9.4.2 In December 1999, General Assembly Resolution 54/219 created the UNISDR, as a successor
of the secretariat of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, in 2001. Assembly
resolution 56/195 mandated the secretariat to serve as the focal point in the United Nations
System for the coordination of disaster reduction and to ensure synergies among the disaster
reduction activities of the United Nations Systems and regional organizations and activities in
socio-economic and humanitarian field
9.4.3 In 2005, the assembly, through resolution 60/195, endorsed the” Hyogo Declaration” and
“Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and communities
to Disaster” adopted by the world conference on Disaster Reduction, held in Kobe, Hyogo,
Japan. The Hyogo Framework for Action has tasked the ISDR Secretariat with supporting the
implementation for the strategic objectives identified therein.
9.4.4 Mission: In order to build the resilience of nations and communities to disasters through
the implementation of the HFA , the UNISDR strives to catalyze, facilitate and mobilise the
commitment and resources of national, regional and international stakeholders of the ISDR
system.
9.4.5 The mission of UNISDR is to be an effective coordinator and guide all its ISDR partners,
globally and regionally, to:
• Mobilise political and financial commitments to disaster risk reduction and Hyogo Framework
for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters (HFA);
• Develop and sustain a robust, multi stake-holder system;
• Provide relevant knowledge and guidance.
9.4.6 Functions and Responsibilities: The International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR)
was adopted by United Nations Member States in 2000 and is owned by local, national, regional
and international organisations. UNISDR is led by an Assistant Secretary-General for Disaster
Risk Reduction and overseen by the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, who also
serves as the Chair for the wider ISDR system of partnerships. The mandate of UNISDR is to act
as the focal point in the United Nations system for the coordination of disaster reduction and to
ensure that disaster risk reduction becomes integral part to sound and equitable development,
environmental protection and humanitarian action.
9.4.7 ISDR mechanisms: The various mechanisms have been developed to achieve the mission
which are enumerated as follows:
• The biennial Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (GFDRR) acts as the main global
forum for continued and concerted emphasis on disaster reduction. Open to all states and
the ISDR stakeholders, it primarily assesses the progress made in the implementation of the
HFA, enhances awareness of disaster risk reduction, share experiences and learn from good
practices, also identify remaining gaps and necessary actions to accelerate national and local
implementation;

177

Disaster Management in India
• It acts as Regional platforms for disaster risk reduction, including ministerial meetings, led by
regional inter-governmental organisations.
• As an Inter-Agency Group it acts as a venue for ISDR system joint work programming among
the participating organisations (currently FAO, IFRC, ILO, OCHA, UNDP, UNEP, UNESCO, UNICEF,
WFP, WHO, WMO and the World Bank). Thematic platforms led by UN specialised agencies or
technical institutions provide knowledge products and help to report on developments (for
instance early warning, recovery, education, risk identification) etc.
• The Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs also convenes a Management Oversight
Board with his peers (from OCHA; UNDP representing UNDG; the World Bank; WMO; UNEP;
and IFRC). This Board supports the Chair in providing UN system-wide leadership and highlevel advocacy for disaster risk reduction.
• Several stakeholder groups and networks associated with ISDR – among them include a
Scientific Technical Committee, Global NGO Network for DRR, Gender-and-Disasters, media
groupings, an emerging Parliamentarian Network and member state, which participate
actively in ISDR, are called upon in GA and HFA resolution to establish multi stakeholder
national platform for disaster risk reduction to facilitate coordination across sector.

9.5. United Nation Disaster Management Team (UNDMT)
The UNDMT in India is a team comprising of UN agencies such as FAO (Food and Agriculture
Organization), ILO (International Labour Organization), UNDP (United Nations Development
Programme), UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), UNFPA
(United Nations Population Fund), UNHCR (United Nations High Commission for Refugees),
UNICEF (United Nations Children’s Fund), WFP (World Food Programme) and WHO (World Health
Organization).
9.5.1 The primary purpose of the UNDMT in India is
• To ensure a prompt, effective and concerted country-level support to a governmental
response in the event of a disaster, at the central, state and sub-state levels,
• To coordinate UN assistance to the government with respect to long term recovery, disaster
mitigation and preparedness,
• To coordinate all disaster-related activities, technical advice and material assistance provided
by UN agencies, as well as to take steps for optimal utilisation of resources by UN agencies.
9.5.2 UNDMT works very closely with the nodal ministries of the member agencies and provides
support as per the established procedures. UNDMT joined the Asian Development Bank and
World Bank to do an assessment of the reconstruction requirements after the tsunami in 2004
and Kashmir Earthquake in 2005. Based on the joint assessment of the damages in the tsunami
affected states, UN formulated “Tsunami Recovery Programme” to support the tsunami affected
states in their recovery and reconstruction programmes. UNDMT and NDMA have constituted a
working group to undertake some pilot joint initiatives on various aspects of DM.

9.6 United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC)
9.6.1 The United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team is a stand-by
team of disaster management professionals which are nominated and funded by member
178

International Cooperation
governments, OCHA, UNDP and operational humanitarian United Nations Agencies such as
World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and World Health
Organization (WHO). UNDAC is designed to assist the United Nations and governments of a
disaster-affected country in meeting international needs for early and qualified information
during the first phase of a sudden-onset of emergency as well as in the coordination of incoming
international relief at the national level and/or at the site of the emergency.
9.6.2 The UNDAC Team is a United Nations Team of multi-national personnel trained in disaster
management for rapid assessment of priority needs and on-site coordination of international
assistance. The team members are international disaster/emergency managers from all parts
of the world. Under the UNDAC System, whenever a major disaster strikes a country and
international assistance is warranted, the Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(OCHA) deputes a team of experts trained in the UNDAC system to carry out an assessment of
the requirements for assistance as well as coordinating such assistance with the host country.
UN OCHA have empanelled and trained officers worldwide including officers from India. Upon
request of a disaster-stricken country, the UNDAC team can be deployed within hours to carry out
rapid assessment of priority needs and to support national authorities and the United Nations
Resident Coordinator to coordinate international relief on-site.
9.6.3 Officers trained under the UNDAC system ( who have attended the UNDAC Induction and
Refresher courses) are on contract with the UNDAC for a period of two years (a token amount
of 1 USD per year is given to the Officer) after some documentary formalities. After the expiry of
the contract, it has to be renewed. Such officers are known as Active members in the UN OCHA
parlance and they are liable to be requisitioned for disaster assessment by the UN OCHA in any
disaster affected country.
9.6.4 The Government of India have joined the membership of United Nations Disaster Assessment

9.7.1 The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) is a
United Nations body formed in December 1991 by the General Assembly resolution 46/182.
The resolution was designed to strengthen the response of UNO to complex emergencies and
natural disasters by creating the Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA), and replacing the
Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator, which had been formed in 1972. The
OCHA was therefore the result of a 1998 reorganization of the DHA and was designed to be the
UN focal point on major disasters. Its mandate was also expanded to include the coordination of
humanitarian response, policy development and humanitarian advocacy. OCHA is thus an interagency body, serving UN agencies and NGOs in the humanitarian domain. Its main product is the
Consolidated Appeals Process, an advocacy and planning tool to deliver humanitarian assistance
together in a given emergency.
9.7.2 OCHA is headed by the Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency
Relief Coordinator. OCHA has 1,064 staff located across the world. Major OCHA country offices
are located in Afghanistan, Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad, Colombia, Democratic
Republic of Congo, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Palestinian territories, Sri Lanka and Sudan (including
a sub-office in Southern Sudan’s capital Juba), while regional offices are located in Panama City,

Dakar, Cairo, Johannesburg, and Bangkok. OCHA also has some liaison and support staff in New
York and Geneva.

9.8 International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG)
9.8.1 INSARAG is a global network of more than 80 countries and disaster response
organizations under the United Nations umbrella. INSARAG deals with urban search and
rescue (USAR) related issues. INSARAG aims at establishing standards for international USAR
teams and methodology for international coordination in earthquake response. Members of
INSARAG are both earthquake-prone and responding countries and organisations. INSARAG was
established in 1991, following initiatives of international search and rescue teams that responded
to the 1988 Armenia earthquake.
9.8.2 INSARAG Structure: INSARAG policy is determined by its Steering Group. The Steering
Group meets annually to review achievements and areas of improvement. It is composed
of representatives from each INSARAG Regional Group (Africa, Europe, Asia/Pacific, and the
Americas) and the INSARAG Secretariat (FCSS in OCHA-Geneva).
9.8.3 Regional Groups: To facilitate worldwide participation, INSARAG is organized in three
regional groups: Africa & Europe, Asia & Pacific and the Americas. The regional groups meet
annually to exchange information and experiences acquired in previous relief operations,
plan SAR training and discuss methodology for cooperation among SAR teams. It makes
recommendations to the Steering Group for further improvement of international cooperation
and coordination in disaster response.
9.8.4 Working Groups: INSARAG creates regional and international working groups on an “as
required” basis to develop solutions to problems that were identified in regional meetings. The
working groups discontinue after delivering the requested result. All member countries and
organizations are encouraged to participate in INSARAG Working Groups.
9.8.5 INSARAG Membership: INSARAG is a network of stakeholders of international earthquake
response. Any country or organization with international urban search and rescue response
capacity or countries that are prone to earthquakes may join the network. India is a member
of INSARAG Asia Pacific Regional Group and has been participating in the INSARAG meetings
at international and regional levels. Instructors from India participate in the mock exercises
organized by the INSARAG.
9.8.6 India was the Chairman of INSARAG Asia Pacific Regional Group in 2005-06 and organized
the meeting as well as the UNDAC Refresher Course during this period of the chairmanship. The
INSARAG Guidelines provide guidance for the preparation and deployment of search and rescue
(SAR) teams for international disaster response operations to earthquake-prone countries as well
as checklists for the minimum requirements of USAR teams envisaged for international response
operations. The INSARAG Guidelines define coordination and cooperation procedures for
international and national responders in major disasters. The following phases are covered:
• Preparedness
• Activation
• Operation
• Reassignment/stand-down
• Return to home base.

180

International Cooperation
In addition, the guidelines focus on topics of particular concern to any organisation that
are deployed to international emergency response operations. These include background
information about the international humanitarian environment and an explanation of the role
of the United Nations system (i.e. OCHA and other UN Humanitarian Agencies) as well as the
concept for the On-Site Operations Coordination Centre (OSOCC).
9.8.7 USAR Exercises: Each year, INSARAG organises regional USAR simulation-exercises and
awareness training courses. These events provide a platform to introduce and practice disaster
response coordination methodology as defined in the INSARAG Guidelines. The exercises and
courses are typically hosted by earthquake-prone countries. The target audiences are national
disaster managers, the UNDAC team, IHP Support Modules as well as domestic disaster response
teams and international USAR teams. The recent INSARAG Asia-Pacific Earthquake Response
Exercise was held in Agra, India from 3-6 May, 2011.

9.9 Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction (GFDRR)
9.9.1 GFDRR was set up in September 2006 jointly by the World Bank, donor partners (21
countries and four international organisations), and key stakeholders of the International
Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UN-ISDR). It is a long-term global partnership under the ISDR
system established to develop and implement the HFA through a coordinated programme for
reversing the trend in disaster losses by 2015. Its mission is to mainstream disaster reduction
and climate change adaptation in a country’s development strategies to reduce vulnerability
to natural hazards. At the national and local levels, it also includes other sectoral development
strategies that the countries most vulnerable to natural disasters may undertake to alleviate
poverty and address sustainable growth.
9.9.2 GFDRR has three main business lines (Box 9.2) to achieve its development objectives at the
global, regional and country levels.
Box 9.2: Development Objective at Global, Regional and National Level
Track-I

Global and Regional Partnerships (to strengthen and re-organise ISDR processes
increase its outreach)

to

Track-II

Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) in Development (benefits low to medium
income countries; supports sectoral projects like health, education and research etc.)

Track-III

Standby Recovery Financing Facility (SRFF) for Accelerated Disaster Recovery (focuses in
low income countries).

As and when required, India has been participating in the status of observer in the GFDRR
programme.

9.10 ASEAN Region Forum (ARF)
9.10.1 The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) was established in 1994. The ARF membership including
India, which joined in 1996 is 25 countries. The first ARF meeting in 1994 brought together Foreign
Ministers from Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, European Union (Presidency), Indonesia, Japan,
Laos, Malaysia, New Zealand, PNG, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Russia, Singapore, Thailand,
USA and Vietnam. The current Chairman of ARF is H. E. Pham Gia Khiem, Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ministry Govt. of, Vietnam. ASEAN established the ARF Unit at the
ASEAN Secretariat, Jakarta, Indonesia on 26th June 2004.

181

Disaster Management in India
9.10.2 Based on its Terms of Reference, the ARF Unit’s role and functions are as follows:
• To support the enhance role of the ARF Chair, including interaction with other regional and
international organizations, defense officials dialogue and Track II organizations,
• To function as depository of ARF documents/papers,
• To manage database/registry,
• To provide secretarial works and administrative support, including serving as the ARF’s
institutional memory.
9.10.3 The ARF is the Principle Forum for Security Dialogue in Asia and complements the various
bilateral alliances and dialogues, which underpin the region’s security architecture. The ARF is
premised on the idea drawn from the ASEAN experience that a process of dialogue can produce
qualitative improvements in political relationships. It provides a platform for members to discuss
current regional security issues and develop cooperative measures to enhance peace and
security in the region.
9.10.4 The ARF is characterised by consensus decision-making and minimal institutionalisation.
The ARF concept paper set out a three-stage, evolutionary approach to the ARF’s development,
moving from confidence building to preventive diplomacy and, in the long term, towards a
conflict resolution capability. While the ARF continues to focus on confidence building measures,
ARF members have also agreed that preventive diplomacy should proceed in tandem with these
efforts, particularly in areas of overlap between confidence building and preventive diplomacy.
As all ASEAN members are automatically ARF members, India is actively participating in the ARF
meetings and disaster relief exercises.

9.11 Asian Disaster Reduction Centre (ADRC)
9.11.1 A resolution was adopted at the United Nations General Assembly in 1997 to reduce
damage from natural disasters substantially by designating the 1990s as the International
Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction. Following a series of national conferences held during
the period from 1994 to 1997 to discuss the cooperation for disaster reduction, a ministerial level
conference was held in Kobe, Japan in 1995 in which 28 countries from Asia and other regions
participated. It adopted the Kobe declaration which includes an agreement to consider the
creation of a system which has the functions of a disaster reduction centre for the Asian region.
The Asian Disaster Reduction Centre (ADRC) was thus established in Kobe in 1998 following an
agreement among the participating countries with the Japanese government.
9.11.2 The mission of the ADRC is to enhance disaster resilience of the member countries, to
build safe communities and to create a society where sustainable development is possible. The

Disaster Management in India
9.16.2 In the field of disaster management, UNDP has been engaged with India since the Latur
earthquake in 1993, followed by its involvement in the capacity development programme in
1996. In 1999, after the super cyclone in Orissa, it supported the community-based disaster risk
management programme in 20 blocks in Orissa which ultimately led to the formulation and
implementation of the Disaster Risk Management Programme aimed at building the community’s
resilience in disaster preparedness and mitigation measures. Under this programme, which was
implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Home Affairs, assistance to the tune of US $
41 million was provided to the central government and 17 state governments for disaster risk
reduction primarily at the community level in 176 multi hazard prone districts. It also had an
urban earthquake vulnerability reduction component implemented in 38 cities during 20022009.
9.16.3 After the successful implementation of this DRM Programme, the Government of India
together with UNDP, has launched a new programme for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) with
an outlay of $20 million (approximately ` 100 crores). At present the DRR Programme is being
implemented in 26 states and 58 cities across the country under the overall supervision of
Programme Management Board headed by Secretary (Border Management).
9.16.4 The GOI-UNDP DRR Programme (2009-2012) has two components:
(i) Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)
(ii) Urban Risk Reduction (URR).
9.16.5 DRR project is being implemented by NDMA with an outlay of USD 12.6 million
(approximately ` 63 crores) and URR project is being implemented by Disaster Management
Division, MHA with an outlay of USD 7.4 million (` 37 crores). The Joint Secretary, MHA is the
National Programme Director for URR component. The Joint Secretary, NDMA is the National
Programme Director for DRR component.
9.16.6 The objective and major activities undertaken in the programme are as follows:
Objective: To strengthen the institutional structure to undertake disaster risk reduction activities
at various levels (state, district, city, urban local body) including risks being enhanced due to
climate change, and develop preparedness for recovery.
Major Activities:
• Strengthening the State and District Disaster Management Authorities to fulfil their
responsibilities as stipulated in the Disaster Management Act, 2005
• Developing methodologies and modalities for ensuring risk reduction through integration in
development programmes of all partners at national, state and community levels
• Enhancing the capacity for urban risk reduction by addressing planning capacity building, and
ensuring suitable legislative and regulatory mechanisms to promote safe built environment
• To strengthen the recovery framework, through which the people affected by disasters
(especially the most vulnerable) are able to access resources for rebuilding their lives and
reviving their livelihoods, and
• To strengthen the knowledge and information sharing platform in disaster management.

9.22. Asian Minister Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction (AMCDRR)
9.22.1 Following the World Conference on Disaster Reduction in 2005, several initiatives were
undertaken to strengthen the ISDR system to be able to better respond to current disaster
trends and the increased expectations and demands by nations and communities for supporting
implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015 (HFA).

192

International Cooperation
9.22.2 This has resulted in increased political commitment and financing of disaster reduction,
including development sectors. At the global level more coherence and better coordination
amongst ISDR system partners has been achieved through joint work planning and prioritized
deliverables. A common approach to work programming in the ISDR system was developed
during the 2006-2007 biennium in the context of the former Inter-Agency Task Force on Disaster
Reduction and presented to the first session of the Global Platform.
9.22.3 Those consultations gave rise to an ISDR system joint planning framework for country,
regional and global levels based on the priorities for action of the Hyogo Framework. To monitor
and share the country’s progress at a regional platform, AMCDRR was conceptualized. Since then
four such conferences were held to enhance and promote regional cooperation for seamless
implementation of HFA.
a.

The 1st AMCDRR was held in China in August 2005 known as Beijing resolution with the
strategic objective of enhancing regional cooperation in the implementation of HFA in Asian
region and disaster management cooperation between governments.

b.

The 2nd AMCDRR was hosted by India in November 2007 at New Delhi with the strategic
objective of construction of joint response system through cooperation among each
governments, regional cooperative bodies UN and international organizations.

c.

The 3rd AMCDRR was held in December 2008- known at Kaulalampur, Malasiya, which
focused on cooperative system through “mutual assistance with private sector” between
various parties concerned in the Asian and Pacific region.

d. The 4th AMCDRR was held at Inchon, South Korea during October 2010 known as Incheon
declaration focused on three main themes as mentioned below:
 Raising awareness and building capacity for DRR & CCA
 Developing and Sharing information, technology, sound practices and lessons learned in
climate and disaster risk management.
 Promoting integration of DRR & CCA into development for green growth.

9.23. Conclusion
This chapter has attempted to capture the various international cooperation initiatives. While
India does not seek assistance during the relief and response phases, it welcomes sharing of
expertise and also technical assistance based on various international developments. As a
signatory to the Hyogo Framework of Action, India is also committed to achieve the priorities
and the objectives through systematic and institutional efforts.

Disaster Management in India

The
Way
Forward

10.1 Background
In the last decade there has been a paradigm shift in Disaster Management in India, a distinct
move from the earlier approach of post disaster relief to pre-disaster preparedness, mitigation
and risk reduction. The 10th Five Year Plan document emphasised that “while hazards, both natural
or otherwise, are inevitable, the disasters that follow need not be so and the society can be prepared
to cope with them effectively whenever they occur” and called for a “multi-pronged strategy for total
risk management, comprising prevention, preparedness, response and recovery, on the one hand,
and for initiating development efforts aimed towards risk reduction and mitigation, on the other”. It
is stated that only then we can look forward to “sustainable development.” The country is also
committed to mainstream disaster risk reduction into the process of development planning at
all levels for sustainable development, as stated in Hyogo Framework of Action 2005-15: Building
the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters.

10.2 Recent Initiatives
The 11th five year plan document of Government of India gave impetus to mainstreaming
disaster risk reduction as one of the priority programmes in the development planning process
and disaster management. “Building Back Better” has become the underlining principle in any
post disaster reconstruction and rehabilitation programme implemented by Government of
India. As mentioned in the report of the working group on Disaster Management for the 11th
plan and also in the various initiatives towards this effort, the way forward can be divided in the
following major areas –
• Policy guidelines at the macro level that would inform and guide the preparation and
implementation of disaster management and development plans across sectors,
• Building in a culture of preparedness and mitigation,
• Operational guidelines of integrating disaster management practices into development, and
specific developmental schemes for prevention and mitigation of disasters,
• Having robust early warning systems coupled with effective response plans at district, state
and national levels.
• Building capacity of all stakeholders,
• Involving the community, NGOs, CSOs and the media at all stages of DM,
• Addressing gender issues in disaster management planning and developing a strategy for
inclusive approach addressing the disadvantaged sections of the society towards disaster risk
reduction, and
• Addressing climate risk management through adaptation and mitigation.

10.3 Suggested Steps
To achieve results in these key identified areas, the following suggested steps should be
integral to all stages of DM including developing a culture of prevention by introducing disaster
management in school curricula , professional courses and enhancing the capacity of disaster
managers by strengthening training facilities for disaster management; creating mass awareness
by disseminating knowledge about the hazards and risks and promoting coping capacities of
the communities through community based disaster risk management for better preparedness

195

Disaster Management in India
and response; fostering social and gender equality in disaster risk reduction by planning and
focusing on the needs of the disadvantaged sections of the society. The summarised list of
actions that needs to be taken is as follows:

10.4 Developing a Centralised Database
In collaboration with the Central Statistical Organization (CSO) an integrated Centralised Disaster
database requires to be developed. Data collection on standardised format should be the
responsibility of the concerned state government. Such database would facilitate researchers
and decision makers to undertake range of analyses to better understand the linkages between
disaster management and other sectors that would help in taking up informed risk reduction
activities as well as to understand the impact of disasters on economy.

10.5 Early Warning Systems and Communication and Connectivity upto the Last
Mile
Early warning systems vary for the different types of disasters. Due to recent unprecedented
devastation unleashed by tsunami, often early warning gets linked with tsunami only, masking
the importance of early warning against other forms of disasters. Hazard- specific efficient ‘early
warning systems’ is the need of the hour and it has to be put in place permanently, so that
useful information flows throughout the year and is easily understood by the local community.
There is scope for improvement in flood, cyclone and storm surge warnings. Such projects
need further encouragement and newer projects should be accorded high priority. Even with
the best of early warning systems, the impact may still be catastrophic if early warning signals
are not properly interpreted and communities are not educated and trained to respond to the
early warning signals in real time. Therefore, the technology to early warning, on the one hand
and, community response to early warning to the other are urgently required. This needs to be
coupled with the National Emergency Communication Plan to ensure real time dissemination of
early warnings and information to the ‘at risk’ community and the local authorities.

10.6 Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs)
EOCs in the country could play a critical role in coordinating emergency activities as well as
in providing information to various stakeholders. Effective functioning of these EOCs during
emergencies continues to be a major challenge. “State of the art” EOCs at state and district levels
with access to satellite based imageries need to be planned and established.

10.7 Mitigation Plans and Mainstreaming Disaster Management into the
Development Planning Process
10.7.1 Three committees constituted by Government of India are working towards preparing
the National Response Plan, National Human Resource and Capacity Development Plan and
National Mitigation Plan in respective ministries that have been designated as nodal agencies for
various disasters. The draft National Response Plan and National Human Resource and Capacity
Development Plan are ready. Certain rectifications and modifications are underway before it is
presented to the National Executive Committee for its finalisation.
10.7.2 It is expected that National Response Plan will be put in place once it is adopted by
Government of India. It will pave the way for institutionalising the response plan in three tiers as
envisaged in the Disaster Management Act.

196

The Way Forward
10.7.3 Similarly, the Capacity Development Plan, once it is approved and adopted will provide
the roadmap for undertaking the capacity building of persons engaged in different facets of
disaster management and enhancing the capacities both at the individual and organizational
levels.
10.7.4 So far, Ministries of Defence, Mines (Geological Survey of India), Department of Atomic
Energy, Department of Agriculture & Cooperation, Railways and Water resources have submitted
their mitigation plans which are under examination and finalisation. Once these mitigation
plans are approved, the concerned Ministries will undertake the recommended prevention and
mitigation measures to address the hazards and risks involved in the core activities of their sector.
It is the endeavor of the Government to persuade the other ministries to bring their mitigation
plans at the draft stage and take it further for its approval and adoption.
10.7.5 Working Group on Disaster Management: Planning Commission, GOI, has constituted
a working Group on Disaster Management for providing inputs to the 12th Five year Plan (20122017) vide no. M-12016/03/2011-PAMD. The Terms of Reference (specific to working group) were
as under;
a.

To recommend measures to streamline existing institutional structure on disaster
management in order to avoid multiplicity of structures keeping in view the provision of the
Disaster Management Act 2005.

b.

To review implementation of disaster management policy towards disaster risk reduction,
preparedness and mitigation at Centre and State levels and in the private sector.

c.

To explore innovative ways and means for applicable of Science & Technology in disaster risk
reduction.

d.

To draw a roadmap and policy framework to encourage public-private partnership and
community participation in disaster management.

e.

To assess integration of disaster management related concerned to be inbuilt central sector
and centrally sponsored schemes/projects.

f.

To suggest programmes for capacity building for disaster mitigation at Centre, State and
district levels with special reference to rural and urban area.

g.

To indentify priority areas and projects along with financial resources to be undertaken
through NDMA. Central Ministries and State Govts in integrated manner during the 12th Plan
period

10.8 Strengthening the Preparedness Phase
Some of the illustrative areas and activities that would reduce the risk from hazards in the
preparedness phase are summarised as follows10.8.1 Urban Planning and Zoning: There is a need to enhance the efforts for integrating
disaster risk reduction elements in settlement planning and land use zoning to mitigate flood and
earthquake risks. This issue had been mentioned repeatedly at different for a by administrators,
practitioners and NGOs working in the area of disaster management. Human settlements must
be viewed not only from the perspective of their vulnerability, but also from the perspective of
the disasters that they create or that they exacerbate. There is an urgent need to examine such
settlements being developed by private builders and developers, which could increase flood

197

Disaster Management in India
vulnerability in urban and rural areas of many states. Planned urban settlements and housing is the
need of the day for disaster risk management that leads to sustainable development, particularly
in ecologically sensitive regions, high risk locations and high population density pockets.
10.8.2 Building Codes and Enforcement: Building codes are adhered to only in engineered
structures and not in the huge majority of houses across rural and urban India. The building
codes have to be continually upgraded with the advent of new information and technology.
The greatest challenge, however, is in respect to enforcement of the building codes.
10.8.3 Housing Design and Finance: It has been difficult to ensure compliance to disaster
resistant technology at individual house level. There is need to find alternative ways to encourage
and facilitate individual home builders to use disaster-resilient designs, materials and techniques
in the construction of their homes. Publicity and audience friendly information emphasising
appropriate designs and the cost differences will go a long way in creating awareness among
people for their adoption. Some financial incentives or tool may motivate people, particularly
poor people or first-time house owners, to incorporate safety features in their houses.
10.8.4 Flood Proofing: This is an approach adopted in parts of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and few
other flood prone states of the country for reducing flood vulnerability. Flood proofing involves
constructing earthen mounds to raise entire homesteads—the house, the vegetable garden,
livestock pen, grain stores, toilets and water wells above the flood level. Encouraging such good
practices in other flood prone parts of the country, would go a long way to reduce the risk in
such area.
10.8.5 Promoting development of new financial tools: There is need to work for development of
new financial tools such as catastrophic risk financing, risk insurance, catastrophic bonds, microfinance etc. Risk transfer and risk insurance mechanisms would be needed for infrastructure,
crops and other assets. Making risk insurance mandatory at least in highly hazard prone states
in the country needs to be encouraged. Insurance distributes disaster risk among the broader
society and makes great sense when risk has been reduced to some acceptable level.
10.8.6 Agriculture and Aquaculture: These projects should be assessed from the perspective of
the flood hazards. Much of the flooding that affects large rural habitats and agricultural lands is
because of reduced drainage as a result of the expansion of agricultural activities into wetland
areas that previously served an important drainage function. Mainstreaming disaster risk
management such development of agriculture practices should have compensatory drainage
factored into agricultural expansion plans.
10.8.7 Roads and Infrastructure: Standards are generally set to protect roads, railways, power
and communication infrastructure from being damaged or destroyed by a 10 or 20 or 50 year
flood level. Any new infrastructure project should conduct a disaster impact analysis and ensure
that construction does not impede water flow and cause deeper or prolonged floods. Designing
the roads to the higher standards requires factoring of not only the vulnerability of the roads to
floods but also their contribution to hazard.
10.8.8 Logging activities: These activities in the hilly areas destabilise slopes, cause landslides
and increase mudflow and silting in the nearby rivers. The revenue generated by logging is far
lesser than the losses incurred due to the serious problems of landslides, silting and ecological
disturbance caused. There should be a plan for afforestation in the logging area before or just
after the logging.

The Way Forward

Box 10.1: Risk Transfer mechanisms-Insurance as a financial tool for Disaster Management
For decades, the financing of disasters has relied on a reactive approach consisting of the diversion of

funds from the domestic budgets. Such “ex post” funding approaches are inefficient, often
poorly targeted and insufficient. Moreover, they provide no incentive for proactive risk
reduction measures such as improved urban planning, higher construction standards, etc.
Reactive approaches to risk financing are becoming increasingly unsustainable as vulnerability
is increasing and emerging economies grow and accumulate more assets. The funding gaps
between available donor resources and post-disaster funding will grow if disaster prone
countries do not engage in risk reduction and pre-disaster risk financing.
Insurance markets in the majority of developing countries are underdeveloped. Where hazard
coverage exists, it is usually limited to major industrial and commercial properties and some
wealthier households.
For a number of years, efforts are on to promote a more proactive approach to risk financing.
A number of examples come from World Bank led efforts, including the provisions of technical
support to Mexico in issuing a cat bond; contingency financing arrangements in Cambodia,
the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facilities (CCRIF - the first regional institution which
allows the eighteen participating countries to pool their risk and save on individual premium
payments), the Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool (TCIP - a mandatory earthquake insurance
pool for homeowners). These initiatives provide much needed, immediate liquidity after a
disaster for more effective government response.
Micro disaster Insurance: It has great potential, but faces several challenges before it becomes
a sustainable mechanism for effective risk management for the poor. The study by ProVention
Consortium and the International Institute of Applied System Analysis found that micro
Insurance holds great potential to protect the poor from disaster shocks.
Financial Viability: Disaster Insurance should be based on sound estimates of low-probability,
high-consequence risks so that the premium can be priced and the requisite capital reserve or
reinsurance can be assured. Where there is a high degree of ambiguity with the risk estimates
of extreme events, international donors may need to provide incentives for the private sector
involvement in such schemes.
Affordability: Micro insurance needs to be affordable to low income-clients. Disaster insurance
premiums include the costs of handling many small contracts, distributing the product often to
remote areas, as well as assuring sufficient capital to cover dependant claims. There are several ways
to reduce disaster insurance premiums. The most obvious is subsidies from the public authorities,
international donors or those at lower risk in the insurance pool (cross subsidies in insurance systems).
The Hungarian government is providing subsidies to poor households as part of a recently legislated
flood insurance pool. In the UK, extensive cross subsidies in the private flood insurance systems make
it affordable to low income households. In developing countries, transaction costs can be minimised
by offering policies to groups or communities through established microfinance institutes. The high
costs of capital reserves and reinsurance can be lowered through government or donor provision of
reinsurance. An example is the Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool, where the World Bank reinsures a
layer of risk for the pool.

199

Disaster Management in India
10.8.9 Design and construction of critical infrastructure and lifeline facilities (hospitals/
schools etc): It has been observed in the past disasters that schools and hospitals are badly
affected. Therefore, construction of all new schools and hospital needs to be brought under the
regime of disaster resistant technology.
10.8.10 Medical Preparedness for recovery of affected person in any kind of disaster is of
paramount importance. There exits huge gap between demand and supply of medical care,
particularly in the area of trauma care. This needs to be strengthened and capacity augmented
at every level from primary to referral level. The capacity of doctors and Paramedical staff also
needs to be strengthened and to be geared to meet the challenges of post-disaster recovery.

10.9 Capacity Building Plan
In addition to development of National Human Resource Plan, a training calendar of Disaster
Management institutes and agencies at the international, national and sub-national levels needs
to be compiled and publicised so that the stakeholders could avail of the opportunities to build
capacities.
10.9.1 Concerted efforts are required to work closely with UN agencies, bilateral agencies and
NGOs for DRR. Bilateral and Multilateral Cooperation with countries prone to hazard and those
having developed expertise in management of different disasters and international institutions
for DRR would facilitate and encourage participation of professionals and officials in national
and international events in enhancing their capacities.
10.9.2 International collaboration in the field of disaster management should be strengthened.
The NDMA and NIDM have to play a key role in awareness generation and engage with print,
electronic and folk media to carry forward programmes for public awareness. There is also a
great need to develop the capacity and sensitise the media to comprehend disaster awareness
and reporting, so that it plays a positive role in creating awareness and in handling disaster
information and news during emergencies.
10.9.3 In order to address the issue of structural safety against multi-hazards, steps that
lead to improvement of construction on the ground need to be initiated. This would entail
enhancing community awareness, capacity building of architects and masons, strengthening of
enforcement, etc.
10.9.4 Inter-state sharing of resources has been very effective in the past. Such sharing should be
facilitated by encouraging states to enter into mutual agreements with each other on possible
nature and type of resources that can be shared and set up administrative mechanisms for
implementing these effectively.

10.10 National, State and District Level Response Plans
The recent Japanese earthquake, tsunami, followed by fire and the nuclear energy crisis is a
pointer to the fact that despite best preparedness and mitigation and capacity building plans
being in place, response and crisis management plans continue to be relevant. To put things
in place an effective response plans at the National, States, Districts and the Sub-districts level
should therefore, be encouraged to strengthen review and update the existing capacity for
response and crisis management.

200

The Way Forward

10.11 Corporate Social Responsibility
Business entities are expected to shoulder responsibilities for the impact of their activities on
the consumers, employees and community as a whole. Efforts are therefore needed to engage
corporate bodies in undertaking disaster risk reduction activities as a part of their corporate
social responsibilities. NDMA and NIDM have to actively engage with the corporate sector in
mainstreaming DRR within their CSR framework.

10.12 Integrating Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction
The current trends of climate change are expected to increase the frequency and intensity of
existing hazards, an increased probability of extreme events, spur the emergence of new hazards
and vulnerabilities with differential spatial and socio-economic impacts. This is likely to further
degrade the resilience and coping capacities of poor and vulnerable communities, who make
up from a quarter to half of the population of most Indian cities Vulnerability has typically
contributed more to overall risk in India than hazard exposure. The efforts for integrating
climate change and DRR measures needs to be further strengthened and institutionalised and
community be sensitised to take up such adaptive measures, which reduces their vulnerability.

10.13 Conclusion
The above mentioned initiatives are only an indicative list of actions requiring attention.
Every stakeholder involved needs to contribute his bit in order to ensure that the increasing
hazards and risks and the vulnerabilities get addressed in a planned and systematic manner,
thereby increasing the coping capacities of the communities at large and making them resilient
to the impacts of disasters. The Government is committed to structure and convert these
requirements into actionable format to place them on a roadmap and source the funding for
their implementation.

for the use of land, including consideration of long term economic, social and environmental
objectives and the implications for different communities and interest groups, and the
subsequent formulation and promulgation of plans that describe the permitted or acceptable
uses.
Mitigation
The lessening or limitation of the adverse impacts of hazards and related disasters.
Preparedness
The knowledge and capacities developed by governments, professional response and recovery
organizations, communities and individuals to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover
from, the impacts of likely, imminent or current hazard events or conditions.
Prevention
The outright avoidance of adverse impacts of hazards and related disasters.
Prospective Disaster Risk Management *
Management activities that address and seek to avoid the development of new or increased
disaster risks.
Public Awareness
The extent of common knowledge about disaster risks, the factors that lead to disasters and the

205

Disaster Management in India
actions that can be taken individually and collectively to reduce exposure and vulnerability to
hazards.
Recovery
The restoration, and improvement where appropriate, of facilities, livelihoods and living
conditions of disaster-affected communities, including efforts to reduce disaster risk factors.
Residual Risk
The risk that remains in unmanaged form, even when effective disaster risk reduction measures
are in place, and for which emergency response and recovery capacities must be maintained.
Resilience
The ability of a system, community or society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate
to and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner, including through
the preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions.
Response
The provision of emergency services and public assistance during or immediately after a disaster
in order to save lives, reduce health impacts, ensure public safety and meet the basic subsistence
needs of the people affected.
Retrofitting
Reinforcement or upgrading of existing structures to become more resistant and resilient to the
damaging effects of hazards.
Risk
The combination of the probability of an event and its negative consequences.
Risk Assessment
A methodology to determine the nature and extent of risk by analysing potential hazards and
evaluating existing conditions of vulnerability that together could potentially harm exposed
people, property, services, livelihoods and the environment on which they depend.
Risk Management
The systematic approach and practice of managing uncertainty to minimize potential harm and
loss.
Risk Transfer
The process of formally or informally shifting the financial consequences of particular risks from
one party to another whereby a household, community, enterprise or state authority will obtain
resources from the other party after a disaster occurs, in exchange for ongoing or compensatory
social or financial benefits provided to that other party.
Socio-natural Hazard *
The phenomenon of increased occurrence of certain geophysical and hydro meteorological
hazard events, such as landslides, flooding, land subsidence and drought, that arise from the
interaction of natural hazards with overexploited or degraded land and environmental resources.

206

Glossary
Structural Measures
Any physical construction to reduce or avoid possible impacts of hazards, or
application of engineering techniques to achieve hazard-resistance and resilience in
structures or systems;
Non-structural Measures
Any measure not involving physical construction that uses knowledge, practice or agreement
to reduce risks and impacts, in particular through policies and laws, public awareness raising,
training and education.
Sustainable Development
Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs.
Technological Hazard
A hazard originating from technological or industrial conditions, including accidents, dangerous
procedures, infrastructure failures or specific human activities, that may cause loss of life, injury,
illness or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and
economic disruption, or environmental damage.
Vulnerability
The characteristics and circumstances of a community, system or asset that make it susceptible
to the damaging effects of a hazard.
